The President declared January 25 of every year as the Day of National Remembrance for the heroic sacrifice of the forty-four uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Special Action Force through Proclamation No. 164 which was signed on February 21, 2017.

On January 25, 2015, forty-four uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police Special Action Force were killed in the line of duty while serving a warrant of arrest to a known terrorist in Mamasapano, Maguindanao.

The proclamation states, "I ask all our countrymen to remember the heroism of the SAF 44 and recall the daily sacrifices of our uniformed personnel for the sake of the continued peace and security of our Nation."
