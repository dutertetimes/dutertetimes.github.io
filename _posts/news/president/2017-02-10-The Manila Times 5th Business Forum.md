The President delivered his keynote address at The Manila Times (TMT) 5th Business Forum on 10 February 2017 held at the Marco Polo Hotel, Davao City where he received a caricature symbolizing the 'Man of the Year' 2016 award.

According to Dr. Dante Ang, Chairman Emeritus of The Manila Times, the 2016 Man of the Year is given to "the leader of the masses who broke the mold of traditional politics and rose to power to set a new direction for the Philippines on the path of graft-free governance and new foreign policy partnerships toward real peace, a society free of illegal drugs, and sustainable prosperity."
He added that the award "goes to the man who has captured the imagination of the Filipino people and set off the dawn of new politics."

The event follows this year's theme, "The Philippine Economic Outlook 2017: Peace Toward Sustainable Prosperity."
Talks on economic visions of the country under the current administration emphasized plans and policies for growth considering the Philippines is one of the fastest growing economies in the Asian region.

Department of Finance (DOF) Secretary Carlos 'Sonny' Dominguez stressed the objectives of the administration.
"The Duterte administration is pushing a broad range of institutional and economic reforms. With the goal not only of achieving high growth but also shaping that growth so that it will become truly inclusive. To achieve that goal, our growth must be investment-led instead of consumption-led," he said.

The event was attended by Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella, the Ambassador of China to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua, Ilocos Norte Governor Maria Imelda Josefa 'Imee' Marcos, and TMT President Dante Francis Ang II.
