In the evening of the National Heroes Day, 29 August, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte hosted a dinner in Malacañang in honor of the selected sixty-four Filipino soldiers who were wounded-in-action against the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) and the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) New People's Army (NPA) in Western and Central Mindanao. They are considered to be modern-day heroes of the country.

The President assured them of his full support and that under his presidency the welfare of all soldiers will be taken care off.
He reported the release of PhP 4.6 billion pesos for the widows and retired soldiers.
Financial support will continue for the wounded soldiers and aside from the salary increase, promotions are in the works. 

"Do not be too sentimental about it because there is life after being wounded," the President encouraged.
He urged every soldier to go the extra mile and start rebuilding their lives not just for themselves but for the betterment of the nation.

The President promised programs for soldiers who cannot return in the battlefield, vowing to help them make their lives more meaningful and productive as they undergo rehabilitation.

The President assured, "I was always there when they needed me. And for as long as God will give me the productive years of my life at 71, I will be at the Presidency to protect you.".
