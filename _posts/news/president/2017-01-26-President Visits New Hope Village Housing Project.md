The President along with other government cabinets visited Tacloban City, Leyte on 25 January 2017 to see the housing projects and situation of Yolanda victims.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte urged the public officials to expedite services and works as he cited indolence as one of the major problems in the government, relating to the slow response and assistance given to the communities affected by Super Typhoon Yolanda. 

"Most of the people in the government take for granted the people's interest... Galit ako kasi three years after, 'yan lang ang natrabaho ng gobyerno. And the first time I came here, I was not really pleased," he said in his speech during his visit to the New Hope Village Housing Project in Tacloban City. 

He also challenged the government officials to finish the rehabilitation projects and to properly relocate all the affected families until March.

Tacloban City Mayor Cristina Romualdez expressed her gratitude to the President for keeping his promise to revisit Tacloban City. 

"Two months after November 8, 2016, President Duterte's return speaks a lot of the national government's thrust to ensure that the displaced residents get decent housing and a second chance of a safer and better living conditions. The presence of the President is a clear indication that the national government is there, is here with us to share our efforts to achieve a safe, self-sustaining and vibrant community that will nurture future generations of all Taclobanons," she said. 

She gave assurance that the local government is committed to continually work in bringing utilities and infrastructures, better social, educational and health services through satellite offices, and more job and livelihood opportunities through faster business license issuance for the residents.
