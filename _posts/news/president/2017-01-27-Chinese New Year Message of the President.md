The President sends his Chinese New Year message on 28 January 2016.

##### MESSAGE

Each beginning signals new chances and vast opportunities for change, and change can mean a forward move, a rising, or a leap towards a better station, a steady ground, a reason to be grateful for and proud of the gift of life, and the fulfillment of our aspirations.

The government shares the joys and hopes of our Chinese friends and Chinese â€“ Filipinos who have found a root and reason for staying in the country.

They have enriched the Filipino culture and history on their own. They have contributed to the economy by trade and investments. Their cuisine has been dearly familiar to many Filipino homes.

Their philosophy and attitude in life are a wellspring of practical lessons that all of us, regardless of nationality, can learn from.

May all of us develop a more profound appreciation of our heritage as two distinct yet intertwined peoples, and further fortify the goodwill that we have shared over the years.

To everyone else who believes in the miracle of beginnings and who makes a choice for hope against fear, my best wishes on this auspicious season of the Chinese New Year.
