The President led the ceremonial switch-on of the first prototype of the Solar-Powered Irrigation System (SPIS) in barangay New Janiuay, M'lang, North Cotabato on 3 January 2017.

Department of Agriculture (DA) Secretary Emmanuel Pi単ol spearheaded the establishment of the prototype non-inverter solar powered irrigation system in its pilot site located in a land owned by Antonio Jugos and Alfonso Palmares and first tested on 22 December 2016.

The 50 solar panels could pump out between 800 to 1,000 gallons per minute on intensely hot days and 400 gallons under overcast skies.
According to a technical study made by the Department of Agriculture's Central Agriculture and Fisheries Engineering Division (CAFED), it could irrigate 15 hectares every day or 150 hectares in 10 days.

According to the Secretary the system could be established in less than a month with at least 10 crew workers with an estimated development cost of P50,000 to P60,000 per hectare.
The big irrigation systems of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) cost ranges from P350,000 to P450,000 per hectare of rice farm.
The SPIS is about P300,000 lower per hectare.

The barangay Janiuay SPIS is the first small-scale irrigation system using solar power commissioned by the Department of Agriculture.
The project is targeted to cover 500,000 hectares over the next five years and is expected to contribute largely to the DA's program to attain rice sufficiency during the Duterte administration.

"Theoretically, if each of the 15 regional offices of the DA would engage 20 working teams each, the DA through the Bureau of Soils and Water Management could irrigate 360,000 hectares of the 2.6-million hectares of rain-fed areas or 1.44-million hectares within the next four years of the Duterte Presidency," Pi単ol  emphasized.
The secretary said he had recommended to the President to declare the solar-powered irrigation as a flagship project of the department and ask Congress for P20 billion for the project starting 2018 to 2022.
