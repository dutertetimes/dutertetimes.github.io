President Rodrigo Roa Duterte met with the families of the slain Special Action Force (SAF) 44 at the Heroes Hall in Malacañang.

The President listened to the remarks of each representative of the families who asked for the assistance in seeking justice for the deaths of their family members.

Ms. Erica Pabalinas (wife of SAF Team Leader P/SInsp. Ryan Pabalinas), Mr. Guillermo Tria (father of P/SInsp. Max Jim Ramirez Tria and representing Luzon area families), Mr. John S. Anniban (father of P/SInsp. Cyrus Anniban and representing Cordillera area families), Ms. Melanie Duque (wife of PO3 Andres Duque Jr. and representing Visayas area families), and Ms. Rohirmina Asjali (wife of PO3 Jedz-in Abubakar Asjali and representing Mindanao area families) were among the attendees.

In his keynote address, President Duterte said that he is tapping the Philippine National Police (PNP) through Director General Ronald Dela Rosa, and the Office of the Executive Secretary to study the matter carefully and to give him their findings by the end of the month.

"Look into it, I'm directing you now...Look at the records of the Senate and everything," he said.

The Commander-in-Chief also said that he would grant a Medal of Valor and would set a "Day of Remembrance" for the SAF 44. "The highest honor that I can give really is to award them the Medal of Valor," he added.

The SAF is a unit of the Philippine National Police (PNP) where 44 policemen were killed in an anti-terror operation in Mamasapano, Maguindanao on January 25, 2015.

Senator Alan Peter Cayetano was also present during the event.
