President Rodrigo Roa Duterte spoke before the Spear Troopers of the Philippine Army's (PA) 9th Infantry Division (9ID) during his visit at Camp Elias Angeles in Pili, Camarines Sur.

The President discussed the country's serious problem on illegal drugs and called on the military to continue the fight against this menace even after he finishes his term, asking them not to abandon this problem because it would surely destroy the nation's children and the next generation.

Likewise, he showed the thick list bearing the names of people involved in the illegal drug trade and said that the same copy would be provided to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP).

He also injected a light moment when he gave away Glock 30 pistols, saying that he likes the Glock 30 because it resembles his monicker, DU30. At the same time, he assured the military that government would provide all the necessary equipment to them, citing the improvements being done at the military hospital and the conversion of the presidential plane to an air ambulance.

The Commander-in-Chief stressed that all he asks is to be given a peaceful republic.

The Spear Division of the 9ID is the PA's primary infantry unit tasked to combat the communist insurgency in the Bicol region.
