According to Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed the approval of the conferment of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Medal of Valor (Medalya ng Kagitingan) to the remaining 42 ill-fated Special Action Force (SAF) personnel who died during in Mamasapano anti-terror raid in 2015.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed today, February 8, the approval of the conferment of the Philippine National Police Medal of Valor (Medalya ng Kagitingan) to the remaining 42 ill-fated Special Action Force personnel, who died during the botched Mamasapano anti-terror raid in 2015.

The Medal of Valor is the highest award that can be bestowed to a member of the Philippine National Police.

The decision came in the wake of the second anniversary of the Mamasapano clash, following the promise made by the Chief Executive during the dialogue with the families of the SAF 44 personnel held in January at the Heroes Hall of Malaca√±an.

During the dialogue, the President underscored the importance of recognizing the heroism of not only two but all of the 44 fallen policemen. It can be recalled that only two of the 44 SAF personnel were conferred with the Medal of Valor award in 2016, while the remaining 42 were merely given the PNP Distinguished Medal (Medalya ng Kabayanihan) award.

"Bakit dalawa lang ang [Medal of] Valor? Eh lahat naman 'yun namatay... So I am asking [PNP Director General Ronald] Dela Rosa to study the matter very carefully and look that up... Tutal nandiyan na 'yung records, hindi naman kailangan mag-imbestiga-imbestiga. Look at the records of the Senate and everything. And if you think as a soldier that the 44 deserves the [Medal of] Valor, then recommend it and I would give it to them. All of the soldiers, the 44, " the President assured.

Following the approval, the 42 SAF personnel award will be upgraded from the Medalya ng Kabayanihan to the Medal of Valor, which will be bestowed in recognition of their acts of conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life and limb above and beyond the call of duty as members of the Main Effort 1 (ME1), 84th Special Action Company (Seaborne), Rapid Deployment Battalion, Main Effort 2 (ME2), 55th Special Action Company, and the 5th Special Action Battalion of the PNP SAF, respectively.
