The rallying militant groups were escorted by the Presidential Security Group (PSG) into the Malacañan Palace after the inauguration of the new President.
They were received in the Osmeña Room by President Rodrigo Duterte and held a meeting wherein the group presented their 15-point "People's Agenda".
Among those who were part of the meeting were Secretary Renato Reyes of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), Karapatan Secretary General Cristina Palabay, chairman Elmer "Bong" Labog of Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), secretary general Antonio Flores of the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, Kabataan representative Sarah Elago, former Gabriela congresswoman Liza Maza, Anakpawis Representative Ariel Casilao, and Labor Undersecretary Joel Maglunsod.

This open arms gesture of the President, which must be a shock to many, manifests his desire for genuine change for the country.
To recall, President Rodrigo Duterte had offered leftists with positions in his cabinet.
The President assured them of respect of freedom of expression and even permitted them to hold their rally in the first State of the Nation Address (SONA) of the new administration.
The leftists see this reception as a sign of a good start for their collaboration with the government.
