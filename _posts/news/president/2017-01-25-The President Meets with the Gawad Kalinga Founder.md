The President met with the Gawad Kalinga (GK) founder and chairman Antonion 'Tony' Meloto at the Malacañan Study Room on 24 January 2017.

According to Mr. Meloto, they met with the President to discuss possible partnerships with the government to spearhead poverty alleviation projects, such as the 'Kusina ng Kalinga Program' where it plans to feed 50,000 malnourished children everyday, nationwide. They also proposed building centers for social entrepreneurship following GK’s Farm Village University in Bulacan as a model that would target the poor in the countryside.

Officially known as the Gawad Kalinga Community Development Foundation, GK has become one of the country’s leading poverty-alleviation movement that has continuously empowered the marginalized Filipinos through holistic and values-formation programs. Since it was established in 2013, it has worked with over 2,000 communities nationwide. The organization hopes to end poverty for 5 million families by 2024.
