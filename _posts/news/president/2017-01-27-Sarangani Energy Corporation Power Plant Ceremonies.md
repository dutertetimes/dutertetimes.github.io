The President led the ceremonies of the Sarangani Energy Corporation Power Plant (SECPP) in Maasim, Saranggani on 26 January 2017.
These ceremonies are for the switch-on of the first 105-megawatt (MW) section SECPP and the kick-off ceremony of the second 105 MW section of the SECPP.

During the event, President Duterte led the traditional breaking of the wooden Sake barrel (Kagami Biraki), symbolizing harmony and good fortune.

The President was joined in the event by Energy (DOE) Secretary Alfonso Cusi, Sarangani Energy Corporation Chairman Tomas Alcantara, Senator Emmanuel 'Manny' Pacquiao, several foreign dignitaries, financial institution partners, and local government officials of the province.

The coal fired power plant's first 105 MW section began its operations last April 2016 and is currently providing electricity to the provinces of Sarangani, Compostela Valley, Agusan del Norte, and Agusan del Sur, as well as in the cities of General Santos, Iligan, Bayugan, Butuan, Tagum, and Samal, plus some key municipalities in Davao del Norte and South Cotabato.

SECPP's second 105 MW section will commence construction in the first half of 2017 and is targeted to start operating by 2019.

At full 210MW capacity, the plant is able to provide electricity to the entire provinces of South Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga Del Sur and key areas of Misamis Oriental and North Cotabato.
