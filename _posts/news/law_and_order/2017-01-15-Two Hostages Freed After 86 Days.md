The large Korean cargo ship MV Dong Bang Gian 2 was seajacked in international waters off Bongao, Tawi-Tawi as reported by the Armed Forces Western Mindanao Command (WESTMINCOM) on 21 October 2016.
The captain of the ship Chul Hong Park and, Cebuano crewman, second officer Glenn Alindajao were taken by ten (10) armed men at 2:45pm the day before.

The ship had 20 crew members, four Koreans and 16 Filipinos. The rest of were not abducted after they locked themselves in their cabins.

On 14 January 2017, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza advised the President through the Head of the Presidential Management Staff, Bong Go, that the two hostages are en route to meet him in Sulu after a group of "handlers" turned them over to Sulu Governor Abdusakur Tan II.
Dureza said he cannot disclose the names of the "handlers" who turned them over to the Sulu Governor.
The two freed hostages and Dureza flew from Sulu to Davao City in the afternoon.

Dureza spoke to reporters at the office of the Mindanao Development Authority at the old Davao airport area and said that details are not clear at the moment since the former captives are not aware of location details and dates during their captivity. He added that the South Korean embassy will debrief Park and Alindajao.

Dureza thanked Sulu officials for helping in the release of the hostages and acknowledged the help of the MNLF in the process.

"As far as I know, there is no ransom," Dureza said.
"We know the Philippine government policy, we don't engage in ransom negotiations but if there are some efforts taken by the private sector that is there concern and not ours."

Dureza said that the freed hostages said that they were taken by a group headed by a certain Abraham and when Abraham died they were brought to another.
