In a press briefing on Wednesday, 20 July, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales confirmed that the former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo may well face another plunder case.
Ombudsman Morales said that the Ombudsman investigators and prosecutors are finalizing their preliminary investigation.
The new complaint is in connection with the alleged malversation of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) confidential intelligence funds (CIF) during the term of Arroyo. The possibly new plunder complaint concerns a different time frame than the one which was recently dismissed by the Supreme Court due to insufficient evidence and therefore cannot be considered a double jeopardy.

"This is under preliminary investigation, I canâ€™t give you the amount but it covers years 2004 to 2007," Morales said.

"Assuming that we can prove that there was pillaging or ransacking of the public treasury. ... If after preliminary investigation we believe that probable cause lies then we will certainly hail her into court.," she added.

The Ombudsman Field Investigation Office (FIO) has recently filed a plunder and malversation complaint against former President Arroyo according to Laurence Arroyo, Mrs Arroyo's lawyer but without any family relation with. The new complaint stemmed from the alleged misuse of the PCSO confidential intelligence fund (CIF) worth P57 million from 2004 to 2007. Attorney Arroyo said they received a copy of the complaint on June 3 and was given until June 28 to file a counter-affidavit.
