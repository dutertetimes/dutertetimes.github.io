Seven members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) and four military men who were part of the President's advance party enroute to Marawi City were wounded from an explosion of a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) in Lanao Del Sur on 29 November 2016.
The unknown attackers also opened fire on the soldiers.
One PSG member and a soldier were critically injured in the incident.

The President who was at Fort Ramon Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija on 29 November for the inaugration of the new Drug Rehabilitation Facility said,
"My advance party was ambushed a while ago. The Presidential Security Group was hit by an IED [improvised explosive device]."
Duterte insisted after being advised postponing the trip, saying, "But I'm going there. The advice was to postpone it, but I said no. We are taking the same route if possible."

Western Mindanao Command (WESMINCOM) Spokesperson Major Filemon Tan Jr. had confirmed the incident according to CNN Philippines.
Major Tan said an explosion hit the soldiers' convoy shortly after ten in the morning as it drove on a road in Barangay Matampay, Marawi where the Maute group operates.

Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Police Regional Director Chief Supt. Agripino Javier said they received report that a loud explosion believed to be from an IED was heard around 10:30 a.m. in Barangay Emie Punud, Marawi City.
"They were ambushed using an IED while traversing from Iligan City to Marawi City," he said in a text message.

According to Col. Generoso Ponio, deputy brigade commander of the 103rd Brigade, said the personnel were part of a convoy of at least 50 people of the President's advance party in Marawi City including personnel from the Presidential Broadcast Staff Radio-Television Malacañang (RTVM) and military escorts.

ARMM Governor Mujiv Hataman said he has no details on the incident but he knows that the President was scheduled to visit the Army troops who are fighting rebels from the Maute group which is said to have links with ISIS.

The explosion happened near the occupied base of the Maute group also known as the Dawlah Islamiya or 'Islamic State', in Butig town.
Butig is about 800 kilometres south of Manila, and an hour-long drive from Marawi City.

PSG spokesman Col. Michael Aquino sent a text message to Malacañang reporters refraining from confirming whether the attack was meant for the President.
"[We] can't say yet if the attack specifically targeted (President Duterte) as a result of ongoing operations in the area," the PSG spokesman said.
"The security we have will be tight, wherever we go, we will not be careless, we are always on alert as well as our troops who are all adequately trained," Col. Aquino said.

The dentified wounded during the incident are:

* Captain Reynaldo Zamora (PSG)
* Staff Sgt. Renie Damaso (PSG)
* Sgt. Jesus Garcia (PSG)
* Corporal Rodel Genova (PSG)
* Corporal Ron Edward De Leon (PSG)
* Corporal Vincent Paniza (PSG)
* PFC James Gonzales (PSG)
* Ssg. Eufrecino Payumo Jr. (Philippine Army)
* Corporal Joselito Gallentes (Philippine Army)
* Sgt. Eric Ubalde (Philippine Army)
* Corporal Fernando Corpuz (Philippine Army)

The wounded were sent to Camp Evangelista Station Hospital of the Philippine Army's 4th Infantry Division (4ID) in Patag and Polymedic Medical Plaza both in Cagayan de Oro City.
