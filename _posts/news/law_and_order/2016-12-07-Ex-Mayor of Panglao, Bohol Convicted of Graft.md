Former Mayor Doloreich Dumaluan of Panglao, Bohol, has been sentenced to suffer imprisonment ranging from six to ten years after he was found guilty by the Sandiganbayan of violation of Section 3(f) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (Republic Act No. 3019). He was also ordered perpetually disqualified from holding public office.

The evidence presented by the Ombudsman prosecutors established that in May 2005, the Bohol Beach Club (BBC) applied for a locational permit for its expansion project. Despite compliance with all the requirements, Dumaluan refused to sign and issue the permit within a reasonable time.

During trial, Dumaluan admitted that "he owned the property beside the BBC which was the subject of the club's application for a locational clearance."

"Clearly, the accused's refusal to act on the BBC's application for a locational clearance was for the purpose of directly obtaining benefit for himself by protecting his claimed interest in the subject property," the Decision stated.

Section 3(f) of R.A. No. 3019 declares it unlawful for any public officer to neglect or refuse, after due demand or without sufficient justification, to act within a reasonable time on any matter pending before him for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of or discriminating against another interested party.
