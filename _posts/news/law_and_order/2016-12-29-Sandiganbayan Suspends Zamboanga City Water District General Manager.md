The Sandiganbayan has ordered the 90-day suspension pendente lite of Zamboanga City Water District General Manager Leonardo Rey Vazquez, Department Manager Lovell Abad, Division Managers Teotimo Reyes, Jr., Arnulfo Alfonso, Rodrigo Vega and Fernando Camba.

In a five-page Order, the anti-graft court directed the accused to cease and desist from further performing and/or exercising the functions, duties and privileges of their position, or any other position they may now or hereafter be holding, effective immediately.

According to the court, the suspension pendente lite "is mandatory and as repeatedly held by the Supreme Court, there are no ifs and buts about it."

The accused are facing charges for violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and Section 65(2) of the Government Procurement Reform Act. It will be recalled that in 2015, the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict Vazquez, et al. over the rigged bidding of the Pasonanca-Sta. Maria Line rehabilitation project wherein respondents delayed and ultimately failed to conduct post-qualification proceedings.
