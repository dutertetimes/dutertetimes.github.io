The complainant identified Edgar Matobato, a self-confessed Davao Death Squad member, after seeing him appear in a televised Senate committee hearing on extrajudicial on 15 September 2016. "I cannot be mistaken," he said.

Albeto Salcedo Jr., 64 years old, now retired, was an adjudicator at the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) XI.
He was aboard a pickup truck of the department beside the driver when he was ambushed around 5 p.m. on 23 October 2014 along Bonifacio Highway in Barangay Aplaya, Digos City, Davao del Sur.
The gunman whom he identified as Edgar Matobato shot at him in close range.
He sustained six gunshot wounds and three bullets are still inside his body â€“ one in his left knee, one in his large intestine, and the 3rd bullet in his spinal cord.

After seeing the face of Edgar Matobato on television he filed a frustrated murder complaint on 23 September 2016 at the Digos City prosecutor's office assisted by his lawyer and cousin Roy Salcedo together with National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Northern Mindanao Director Cesar Bacani and NBI-Davao Region personnel led by Eric Distor.

"I want justice," Salcedo said in his supplemental affidavit.

Jehrameel Libre, Deputy prosecutor of the City Prosecutor's Office said they will have 60 days to evaluate the case filed by Salcedo, after which they will decide whether to file or dismiss the case against Matobato.

Matobato admitted during the Senate committee hearing that he had been a gun-for-hire but he was not involved in the attempted murder of Salcedo.
He said that he was under the Witness Protection Program (WPP) of the Department of Justice (DOJ) the day Salcedo was shot.
Matobato at the Senate committee hearing on September 22 said he went to the DOJ on 1 September 2014 and had stayed under the WPP until he left it this year.
It is not clear when was the exact date Matobato left the WPP. He just said he left when it had become clear that Rodrigo Duterte was going to win the Presidency.
