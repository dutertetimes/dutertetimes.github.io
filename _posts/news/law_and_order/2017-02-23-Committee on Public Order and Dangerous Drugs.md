Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs held on 23 February 2017 regarding P.S. Res. No. 265 or the inquiry the various reported incidents of kidnap for ransom perpetrated by members of the Philippine National Police in the guise of enforcing "Project Tokhang" which is a centerpiece program of the war on drugs of the administration of president Rodrigo Duterte, with the end in view of expediting the seemingly slow and soft action of the PNP on the perpetrators of said dreadful and appalling activities and ultimately providing remedial legislations that will hasten the investigation and prosecution of similar incidents.
