National Irrigation Administration (NIA) administrator, Peter Tiu Laviña, on 25 January 2017 has ordered all Central, Regional, and Project Offices to publish all the ongoing and proposed irrigation systems for 2017 in their respective regions.

"I would like to make available to the public the lists of projects in their areas of jurisdiction, " Laviña said.

The transparency effort is in support with the current administration's aim to regain the trust and confidence of the public.
"This will help promote open and transparent governance and likewise dispel speculations that NIA is keeping the list to favor certain contractors", the NIA chief clarified.

Laviña also directed all the Regional Managers to timely post all the irrigation projects for bidding on Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PHILGEPS) and increase efforts to encourage more contractors to join project biddings.
