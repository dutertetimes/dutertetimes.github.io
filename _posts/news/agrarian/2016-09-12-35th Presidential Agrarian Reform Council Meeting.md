President Rodrigo Roa Duterte gave his full support to the agrarian reform program when he convened and presided the 35th Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) Meeting in Malacañang to discuss the status of the implementation of the agrarian reform law and other issues with landowners and farmer beneficiaries in the country.

According to Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Secretary Rafael Mariano, they have discussed with the President the five-point thrusts and policy directions of DAR:

1. Protect farmers and ensure their security of tenure;
2. Promote farmers' rights and welfare;
3. Contribute to rural development;
4. Help ensure food security and
5. Strengthen the DAR community.

During the meeting, President Duterte has ordered Landbank to provide more aid for the program.
An executive order is also being prepared to declare a two-year moratorium on conversion of agricultural lands.

Secretary Mariano gave his marching orders to the department heads.
He also ordered the immediate field validation and inventory of all lands given to agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs), a quick inventory of conversion orders issued by DAR and the review of existing contracts with stock distribution plans.

From 1972 to June 2016, more than 4.7 million hectares of lands have been given to 2.7 million ARBs under the [Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP)].

Also included as PARC members are National Irrigation Administration Administrator; Land Registration Authority Administrator; and representatives of affected landowners and agrarian reform beneficiaries from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.
