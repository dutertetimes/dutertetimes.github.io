President Rodrigo Roa Duterte gave his full support to the agrarian reform program when he convened and presided the 35th Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) Meeting in Malacañang to discuss the status of the implementation of the agrarian reform law and other issues with landowners and farmer beneficiaries in the country.

According to Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Secretary Rafael Mariano, they have discussed with the President the five-point thrusts and policy directions of DAR:

1. Protect farmers and ensure their security of tenure;
2. Promote farmers' rights and welfare;
3. Contribute to rural development;
4. Help ensure food security and
5. Strengthen the DAR community.

During the meeting, President Duterte has ordered Landbank to provide more aid for the program.
