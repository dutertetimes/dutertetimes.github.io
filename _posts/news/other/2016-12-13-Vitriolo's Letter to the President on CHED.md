OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT<br>
__COMMISSION ON HIGHER EDUCATION__<br>

December 8, 2016

__HIS EXCELLENCY RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE__<br>
__PRESIDENT__<br>
Republic of the Philippines<br>
Malaca√±an Palace<br>


THRU: __HON. SALVADOR MEDIALDEA__

Dear __PRESIDENT DUTERTE__:

Greetings of peace and good health!

I am Atty. Julito D. Vitriolo, presently the Executive Director IV of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and as the highest ranking career executive service officer in the Commission and head of the Commission Secretariat, with more than 32 years of service in the said agency, I write in behalf of the career and non-career officials and staff on URGENT matters gravely affecting the agency as a consequence of the banning/barring/removal of Dr. Licuanan in the DUTERTE Cabinet.

The recent events and circumstances would show, to my mind and to many of the CHED officials and staff I have talked to, that Dr. Licuanan can no longer be effective in view of irreconcilable differences as well as her failure to tender her courtesy resignation which is tantamount to gross insubordination as mandated by MC 4, thus, constituting serious grounds for the loss of trust and confidence in her as cabinet secretary. Mr. President, we believe that YOUR action in BANNING/BARRING her from attending cabinet meetings or being part of YOUR cabinet is not only tantamount to __loss of trust and confidence__ in her as your ~__ALTER EGO__~ which implies that her future actions can no longer be presumed as your very own acts or mandates, but also __REMOVAL__ from office arising from the nature of the position as a cabinet member ~__who serves at the pleasure of the President__~ and subject to your plenary and illimitable power of control, appointment and removal pursuant to the Constitution.

Thus, this letter humbly requesting guidance on how we, the officials and staff of CHED, shall relate with Dr. Licuanan in view of the foregoing circumstances indicating that she might no longer possesses the authority to govern the agency, thus, ~__USURPING THE AUTHORITY AND POWER OF THE CHED CHAIRMANSHIP__~, and further putting the plans and programs of the __DUTERTE administration__, the operations of the CHED as an agency, the welfare of its stakeholders as well as the use of government funds, in __GRAVE PERIL AND PREJUDICE__.

Today, Mr. President we humbly pray that your good office will now intercede to protect the interest of the vast majority of the men and women of the CHED against the stubborn and recalcitrant self-interest of just one person, who is not even an elected official, and continues her refusal to obey your __LEGITIMATE__, __FAIR AND REASONABLE ORDER__ with impunity and in disregard also of the time-honored principle of __DELICADEZA__.
