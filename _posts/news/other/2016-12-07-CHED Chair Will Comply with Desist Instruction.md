Commission on Higher Education Chairperson (CHED) Chairperson [Patricia Licuanan] said on 5 December 2016 that she would comply with the desist order from President Duterte but will continue work as head of the commission.

Licuanan said in a statement that she received the President's instruction from Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr. in a text message on 4 December 2016.
Licuanan admitted being surprised with the Palace statement citing "irreconcilable differences", noting an earlier conversation with the Chief Executive, whom she said expressed assurance that he would respect her term.

"I assured Secretary Evasco that I would comply. In the meantime, I will continue my work as chair of CHEd," said Licuanan.

She was appointed by former president Benigno Aquino III in 2010 and was reappointed in 2014.
Her fixed term will end in 2018.
