Senator Leila De Lima on President Duterte's Medical Condition issued 18 December 2016.

Our Constitution is clear on this. The public should be informed of the state of health of the President in case of serious illness. 

I don't know if the Palace can even try to argue that the President's condition isn't serious, when we all know that one or more of his ailments have prevented him from attending to his duties in the past. They can argue that the events he missed were not critical, but it remains a fact that he has been rendered unable to work before. When the Constitution says "serious illness" it doesn't have to be a terminal one – if it impacts negatively on the President's ability to discharge his duties, it is obviously a matter of national concern, and the public should be kept informed about his state of health. 

But recent revelations are even more worrying. I am not a physician, but it is my understanding that it is not just the illness itself that we should be worried about, but also the impact or side effects that the medications he is taking may have, especially on his lucidity and ability to make decisions with a clear mind.  

I understand that Fentanyl is an opioid. Not only can it be addictive, I understand that it can also have deleterious effects on the patient's cognitive abilities. What if, God forbid, there is an emergency that requires immediate decisions, and the President is under the influence of such a powerful opioid?  

If the Palace refuses to admit that this is a matter of public concern, I'll have to ask what medication these people are taking to cure them of their seemingly impaired judgment. Now, more than ever, the President needs wise advisers – not sycophants.
