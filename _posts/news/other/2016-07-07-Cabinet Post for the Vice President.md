Afternoon of 7 July after a press statement at the Presidential Hall, the President made a call to the Vice President, Leni Robredo, after PTV reporter Rocky Ignacio asked whether he had settled on a plan to give the Vice President a Cabinet post.

The President asked the Vice President over the phone, "Pwede ka Housing ma’am? Can you be the Housing Secretary? Tanggapin mo ma’am?"
The President was referring to the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) which was previously chaired by former Vice Presidents Noli de Castro and Jejomar Binay.

The voice of the Vice President was inaudible during the phone conversation but the President said, "The Executive Secretary will hand you the appointment," which is indicative that Leni Robredo had accepted the position. The Executive Secretary, Salvador Medialdea, will hand the appointment as HUDCC to the Vice President personally.

Justice Secretary Vitallano Aguirre said in a televised press conference that the Vice President was asked to join the Cabinet meeting on Monday.
