###### JOINT STATEMENT ON THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE GRP AND THE NDFP

We, the Negotiating Panels of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), successfully held the second round of talks from 6 to 9 October 2016 in Oslo, Norway, facilitated by the Royal Norwegian Government (RNG).

At the opening ceremonies, RNG Special Envoy to the Philippines Peace Process, Ambassador Elizabeth Slattum, welcomed the GRP and NDFP delegations. She reiterated the continuing commitment of the RNG to support the GRP-NDFP peace negotiations.

Secretary Jesus G. Dureza, GRP Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (PAPP) reiterated the commitment of the two Parties in the peace negotiations toward resolving the armed conflict.

NDFP Chief Political Consultant Prof. Jose Maria Sison thanked the RNG for its caring and efficient facilitation. He stated that the amnesty and release of all political prisoners are a matter of justice and compliance with the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) and will be a big incentive to the forging of a more stable ceasefire as well as to the acceleration of the peace process.

GRP Panel Chairperson Silvestre Bello III congratulated Fidel Agcaoili for being the newly-designated Chairperson of the NDFP Negotiating Panel and reiterated the determination of the Duterte administration to bring the peace negotiations to a successful conclusion as soon as possible. He also extended his deepest appreciation to former NDFP Negotiating Panel Chairperson Luis G. Jalandoni for his invaluable contribution to the sustained conduct of the peace talks through the years.
