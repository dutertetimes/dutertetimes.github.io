The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) arrived in Subic Bay for a brief port call that highlights the strong community and military connections between the Philippines and the United States, 23 January 2017.

The McCain crew will participate in a series of community service projects and sporting events during the crew's visit to the Philippines.

The ship will also use the stop to conduct some minor repairs with the assistance of Filipino companies.

The Philippines is a longstanding treaty ally of the United States with a more than 70-year history of partnership.  The American and Philippine militaries have worked closely together on areas of mutual interest such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, counter terrorism, cybersecurity and maritime security.

McCain is forward-deployed to the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations in support of security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.
