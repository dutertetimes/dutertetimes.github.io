In response, President Duterte said that the Japan and the Philippines over the past 60 years, the friendly relations has been enhanced. And he expect, he said he would expect that such a relationship will be further strengthened and the Philippines will support Japan in all the related areas.

Okay, thank you for your patience. This is the crux of the meeting. Can I invite questions?

ABELLA: We'll entertain a few questions. Four or five. Please identify yourself.

## Questions and Answers

Q: Mynardo Macaraig, Agence France-Presse. Sir can we get some elaboration on the one trillion yen? How much of that is ODA? How much of that is private sector? And just how will it come in?

KAWAMURA: Okay. The one trillion yen level of support for the business creation, business opportunities creation in the Philippines for the next five years, which includes the Japanese official development assistance, so-called ODA, and Japanese private investments. But the ratio between the official ODA and the private investment, well I cannot say it because this is estimation for the next five years.

Then the next question that may arise is how can we estimate that for the next five years, the one trillion yen? But there's the past trend of the Japanese ODA to the Philippines and Japanese cooperations, direct — foreign direct investments to the Philippines plus other government-related official fund, we call it OOF.

So those are the three figures in the past and then created the possible target for the next five years. The crux, the bottom line of this announcement is that Japan is very eager to promote cooperation for the business and the economic development of the Philippines by utilizing all those available resources.

But at the same time, the Prime Minister also underlined the importance that this is a two-way street. This is not just a one-way flow of the investments, of money. But for a very effective and comprehensive development of the Philippine economy, I'd like to emphasize that the business and investment-friendly environment inside of the Philippines is [unclear] so we very much appreciate if the Philippines' private sector understands this point of cooperating with us.

And then towards that goal, as I said before, today we have agreed to establish the joint committee on the economic cooperation on the infrastructure development.

The top figure of this committee was already named from the Japanese side. We're expecting that the counterpart of the announcement from the Philippines' side, in the next, in the future.

And then we'll make joint efforts. Of course. Yes?

Q: I mean, the one trillion yen, I think that's 8.76 billion dollars. Can you give us a comparative figure for, say, the previous five years of ODA and investment? You said the trend is towards one trillion.

KAWAMURA: Well actually sometimes the figures of each year fluctuates.  You take the ODA for example. Depending on the conditions of the economy, the Philippines have conditions of the natural disasters and so on. So I'll give you the overall figures of the past years.

Japan has thus far have provided the ODA of approximately 20 billion dollars to the Philippines and the Philippines is the most important partner for its economic development and —

Q: [off mic]

KAWAMURA: to the Philippines, from the Philippines side

Q: [off mic]

KAWAMURA: — over the — okay let me check the start of the ODA, maybe over the past 50, plus 50 years, I'll give you later. For the Philippines, Japan has been the absolutely top donor, as you know. Over 50 percent of the cooperations that the Philippines received is from Japan. Thank you.

Q: Good evening. My name is Cliff Venzon from Nikkei. Do we know who are the companies involved on the private sector part of the —

KAWAMURA: For the one trillion?

Q: Yes, and so and whats kind of investments are  they looking at  this.. and then my second is can you give us an idea on—about what happened during the expanded meeting with Japan and the Philippine business delegates and like, how it was facilitated, was the consultation and what did the parties say during that session?

KAWAMURA: First of all, the last question of business related part, I'll come to you later 'cause I did not attend it. And the—which companies? Your first question. At this moment, the list of those companies are not? No.

So it's up to private sector and say initiatives and engagement. So, the role of the government is to create the environment friendly for the investment and the business opportunities.

Q: Are we looking, at this point?

KAWAMURA: Well for now, first of all, we established the committee, joint committee with the Philippines. Then, we will consider what — in which areas, what items—which...

So for example, the ODA based on the necessity, necessity based the ODA. We will estimate, targeting the, of the Philippine nation. So we will elaborate the, this respective demand for the infrastructure and then infrastructure development through the PPP provision.

And the other important economic cooperation matters, we will decide it accordingly. So in this committee—we... first of all we have to decide the formation of the committee members, membership, the frequency of the meeting and [unclear] and so long. And then we will consult such demand for the infrastructure development and estimations and evaluations and the economic development policies and then so on.

Q: The composition of the committee will be—will it be a public and private individuals or –if on the government side at what level is the involvement?

KAWAMURA: Well for the further details, we will decide it later. As far as the Japanese side is concerned, the top of the committee, is already named so easily. He is the senior adviser to the Prime Minister.

Q: Good evening, Kawamura-san, I am Ronron Calunsod from Kyodo News – Manila office. Just two questions. In his remarks, Prime Minister Abe said we also had a fan exchange of views of the regional landscape and agreed to elevate cooperations. I just want to know if a there was a mention of US-Philippines alliance or relations or the importance of the US in the region?

And my second question sir, just a light, on the lighter note, has it been confirmed that Prime Minister Abe will share breakfast with President Duterte at his residence tomorrow in Davao? Thank you sir.

KAWAMURA: For the question on the US, the reference, the alliance of the US — today, in today's meeting there's no — they didn't talk about such an issue and tomorrow, by tomorrowthey are expected to discuss the more international issues, including the regional ones.

I hope that I have a chance to come back to you for further details.

Q: [off mic]

KAWAMURA: I cannot if it's going to be a breakfast or rather format anyway.

Q: Sir Cedric Castillo from GMA 7. Sir, under a relatively new Duterte administration, what is now Japan's role if any on the attempts to improve ties between the Philippines and the US, sir? If any.

KAWAMURA: Sorry the first part of your question is now the Japan's role to which...?

Q:  if there is any — what is Japan's role if any on the attempts to improve relations between US and Philippines?

KAWAMURA: Well, if I recall they have first meeting, between Mr. Duterte and Minister Abe in Tokyo. Not first meeting sorry — the meeting in Tokyo last time. Japan had the option to explain how, what do we think about the value of the Japan and US relations so Japan and the American presence in Asia.

Japan's fundamental position regarding the Japan-US alliance is that it is the cornerstone of our foreign policy and security policy. And it [unclear] security and prosperity and stability in the region, the Asia Pacific region. And this question will see no change whoever becomes the next president. Although, Mr. Trump is going to be soon the President of the United States.

So we'll maintain this position and we'll continue to look closely to the next US administration. So that the region, the Asia Pacific region will be secure and prosperous.

Q: Just a follow-up sir. How does Japan view the seeming pivot to China of the Philippines sir?

KAWAMURA: Im sorry?

MR. CASTILLO: What is Japan's take or what is Japan's view on the pivot of the Philippines towards China?

KAWAMURA: Well if the question is about the Filipino, China relationship. Basically, we should refrain from comment on the some country relations. So the briefing is here, is about today's Summit Meeting so...

Q: Hello sir. My name is Zen Hernandez from ABS-CBN. It's a little bit related to that, I'm not sure if you know, if Prime Minister Abe or Japan is open to joining  multi-lateral talks with the Philippines and China with regards to South China Sea issues?

KAWAMURA: the security talks?

Q: Multilateral talks with regards to the South China Sea issue. The territorial dispute.

KAWAMURA: Those talks is about the ASEAN and ASEAN-led discussion on the issue of South China Sea. If I remember, If I recall the previous ASEAN-related meetings, they discussed this, you know, China, ASEAN will discuss the South China Sea issues.

Japan's stand on the particular issue then was that if such a dialogue and consultation on the issues of South China Sea is conducted by the ASEAN and China. We expect that such a dialogue and consultation they carried out under the condition of the non-militarization of the region of the South China Sea, and the — 

And also, countries seek the peaceful resolution of the dispute. So under those two terms, Japan will expect such a talks should be conducted between the ASEAN and China, that's what he said in the previous round of ASEAN Summit in Laos.

And just take the opportunity of this moment. When we studied the ODA for the Philippines, the answer is 1954, so this year is the 63rd year of the Japanese already.

Q: I'm [unclear] from the Manila Shimbun. I'd like to ask you that this two leaders talks about their program of recalling remains of Japanese soldiers under the recovery [unclear] of Japanese Filipino today.

KAWAMURA: Well to the best of knowledge, they didn't discuss this issue. Can I get back to you later? After the whole meetings I'll check and get back to you. Can I have your business card?

Q: Yes. Thank you very much.

Q: Sir, I'm Andreo Calonzo from Bloomberg. Sir the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Japan has already confirmed that Prime Minister Abe is visiting President Duterte's home in Davao City. So what does this say of the relationship between the two leaders? And how often does the Prime Minister do this visit, personally visit the home of a fellow lead—?

KAWAMURA: It's a good question, I cannot count the numbers in total because he visited so many countries sop far.

As for tomorrow's visit to Davao, where Mr. Duterte is from, he is looking forward very much to visit the home town of Mr. Duterte. Well judging from the previous meeting in Tokyo, when Mr. Duterte came to visit. Mr. Duterte said, he said that Japan and the Philippines are not simply friends but we are more than that. We are more than brothers. So this represents how our two countries are close in terms of the [unclear] relations. This is an eloquent reflection of the existing confidence, trust to the Philippines.

ABELLA:  On that note, we'd like to thank you, Malacañang Press Corps, foreign correspondents. Thank you very much.

KAWAMURA: Thank you very much.

ABELLA: Good evening.
