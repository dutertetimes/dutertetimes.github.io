In 2 September 2008, Senator Richard J. Gordon submitted [Senate Bill No. 2590] during the 14th Congress titled "An Act Increasing the Number of Rays of the Sun on the Philippine Flag from Eight to Nine, Amending for this Purpose [Republic Act No. 8491], Otherwise Known as the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines".

For the explanation of the Senate Bill, the author is its best source.
The following is the text of the Bill.

> ##### EXPLANATORY NOTE
> The Philippine flag was sewn by the revolutionary junta in Hong Kong and first displayed in battle on May 28, 1898. It was formally unfurled during the proclamation of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898 by President Emilio Aguinaldo.
>
> Article XVI, Section 1 of the Constitution provides: "The flag of the Philippines shall
be red, white, and blue, with a sun and three stars, as consecrated and honored by the
people and recognized by law."
>
> The law governing the design, manner of display, and observance of respect for the Philippine flag is Republic Act No. 8491, enacted fittingly in 1998 or on the centennial of Philippine independence. The design adopted the mythical sun (with a face) common to many former Spanish colonies; the.triangle of Masonry; the eight rays representing the first eight provinces that revolted and were put under martial law by the Spaniards during the start of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, namely: Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Manila, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Tarlac. There are three stars representing the three major geographical divisions of the country: Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao.
>
> Not only does the flag represent principles of sovereignty and solidarity of the Philippine nation, it embodies the ideals and traditions of the Filipino people developed over the course of national history. Of history we refer to the period before the arrival of the Spanish up to the present, centuries replete with stories of struggles for independence and victory against colonizers. Behind the stories of the most celebrated names of national heroes lie the stories of our mostly-forgotten Muslim heroes, who displayed tremendous courage in the battles that they fought.
>
> Among the most valiant soldiers were Lapu-Lapu, the king of Mactan, known as the first native of the archipelago to have resisted Spanish colonization. On the morning of April 27, 1521, Lapu-Lapu and the men of Mactan, armed with spears and kampilan, faced Spanish soldiers led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. In what would later be known as the Battle of Mactan, Magellan and several of his men were killed.
>
> There was Sultan Kudarat, who united the Muslim clans in Cotobato, Lanao, and Basilan, and ruled for 50 years. He led many raids and battles against the Spanish from 1634 up to 1668 and inspired the Maranaos to oppose the building of a Spanish fort near Lake Lanao. There is also the story of Sirongan, the Rajah of Buayan, who successfully pushed back the enemy into the coast of Rio Grande, thwarting the first Spanish attempt to colonize Buayan. He killed Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa who led the first Spanish expedition to Cotabato. There are Kaliph Pulaka, Datu Amai Pakpak, Kapitan Laut Buisan, Sultan Jamalu'l Alam, Sultan Muwallil Wasit, Paduka Batara and Panginan Sarikula, who all fearlessly led their men in battles against the Spanish.
>
> With their bravery, our Muslim heroes left an imprint on national history that, at the very least, must be given due recognition in the most heraldic item of national importance the Philippine flag. This bill proposes that the rays of the sun on the Philippine flag be increased from eight to nine, to symbolize the community of Muslim leaders who defended our land. They are our forgotten heroes, and through this proposal we seek to inculcate in the minds and hearts of our people a just pride in their native Muslim brothers who sacrificed their lives for the country's freedom. For these considerations, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

> OF THE PHILIPPINES
>
> Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress assembled:
>
> SECTION 1. Section 4 of Republic Act No. 8491, otherwise known as the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines, is hereby amended to read as follows:
> > "SECTION 4. The flag of the Philippines shall be blue, white and red with a[n] NINE[eight]-rayed golden-yellow sun and three five-pointed stars, as consecrated and honored by the people."
> SEC. 2. This Act shall take effect 15 days following its publication in the Official Gazette or in at least two newspapers of general circulation.

According to the Senate Press Release on 18 February 2009 Senator Gordon prodded the National Historical Institute (NHI) to support his proposed Senate Bill to acknowledge the courage and bravery of Muslim Filipinos who fought for independence from colonialists. He said  that his proposed measure would significantly contribute to achieving unity in the nation as it would send a strong message that Muslims are also Filipinos.[^gordon-prodded-nhi]

"We have to change the mindset of the National Historical Institute if we are to unite our nation. We have had this conflict for a long, long time because we have never embraced our Muslim brothers. I embrace my Muslim brothers. We must be embracing all our people," he said.

27 May 2009, Senator Gordon iterated his proposal to add a ninth ray to the sun in the Philippine flag.[^gordon-iterated]

In 3 June 2009, the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendments, Revisions of Codes and Laws submitted [Senate Bill No. 3307] sponsored by Senator Francis G. Escudero. The Senate Bill was intended as a substitute of Senate Bill No. 2590 and [2994].

23 September 2009, the Senate and House of Representatives approved the addition of a ninth ray to the sun in the Philippine Flag.[^bill-approved]

24 September 2009, the Muslim community was elated by the approval of the ninth ray to the sun of the Philippine flag.[^elation]

"The Bangsa Moro people will never forget Senator Dick Gordon's consistent advocacy of recognizing the heroic struggle for freedom of the Bangsa Moro people that led to the approval of the 9th ray in our country's national flag. Senator Gordon displays his statesmanship and respect for the Filipino Muslims, sorely lacking in our national leaders. May his tribe increase," Datu Ramos said.

Senator Gordon expressed, "This is a great step in recognizing the fact that we had Muslims such as Lapu-Lapu, Sultan Kudarat, Amai Pakpak, Sorongan, who kept fighting the Spaniards long before this country thought of a revolution against Spain. This would foster unity, make sure that nobody is excluded. If we are to have national unity in this country it must begin in our flag, it must be symbolized in our flag."

11 June 2011, in the observance of the 113th anniversary of the proclamation of the Philippine independence, Senator Ramon Bong Revilla Jr. pushed for the modification of the Philippine flag to give recognition to the Muslim Filipinos.[^revilla-push]

## Not the First

House Bill No. 7725 sponsored by Representative Sultan Omar Dianalan of the 1st District of Lanao del Sur petitioned for the addition of a 9th ray in the rays of the sun in the Philippine flag back in 1970s.[^house-bill-7725]
