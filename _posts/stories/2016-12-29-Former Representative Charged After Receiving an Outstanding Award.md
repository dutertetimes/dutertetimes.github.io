Former representative of the 3rd district of Nueva Ecija, Aurelio Umali, was charged by the Ombudsman on 28 December 2016 for graft and malversation of funds amounting to P15 million of Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) in 2005. Umali and a Department of Agriculture (DA) Regional Executive Director was also found guilty of Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. Both government officials were ordered dismissed from service and perpetually disqualified from holding public office. Umali was also charged with Janet Lim Napoles and three others.

This happened a little more than a month after receiving The Outstanding Thomasian ALumni (TOTAL) award, among others, on 18 November 2016. The outstanding award was given "in recognition of the recipients' exemplary contributions in their respective fields". The UST news said, "These Thomasians not only excelled, but likewise remained true to their Thomasian and Christian formation, as evidenced by what they have done."
