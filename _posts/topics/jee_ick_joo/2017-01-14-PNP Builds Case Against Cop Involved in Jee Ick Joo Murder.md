The following is the press release of the Philippine National Police (PNP) regarding the case being built on the kidnapping of Jee Ick Joo in Angeles City, Pampanga on 18 October 2016.

The PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG) believes it has an air-tight case against SPO3 Ricky Sta. Isabel and several other suspects charged for the alleged kidnapping of Korean company executive Ick Joo Jee in Angeles City in October 2016.

PSSupt Glenn Dumlao, AKG Acting Director said Sta. Isabel is among several suspects facing charges of Kidnapping for Ransom and Serious Illegal Detention filed before the Department of Justice in connection with the abduction of Jee.

Sta. Isabel continues to defy the orders of Chief PNP, Director General Ronald M Dela Rosa to submit himself under restrictive custody to ensure his availability to face further investigation in connection with the Jee kidnapping.

Dumlao said, Sta. Isabel was identified as among several men who was seen in security camera footages as shoving Jee into a waiting vehicle. AKG investigators were also able to established Sta. Isabel's presence at the crime scene before, during and after the kidnapping based on CCTV footages, visitor's logbook, and testimony of security guards.

The suspect was also seen in surveillance video recording while making a series of withdrawals from Jee's ATM account, Dumlao said.

Dumlao also disclosed records of Sta. Isabel's alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a certain Mylene Tan.
