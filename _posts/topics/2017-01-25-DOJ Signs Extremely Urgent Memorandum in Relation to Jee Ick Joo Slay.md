Justice Secretary Vitaliano N. Aguirre II signed an "Extremely Urgent Memorandum" dated January 24, 2017 addressed to Bureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Jaime H. Morente, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director Dante A. Gierran, Prosecutor General Victor C. Sepulveda and Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General Ronald M. Dela Rosa placing several PNP personnel in the Immigration Lookout Bulletin Order (ILBO) referring to the case of South Korean businessman Ji Ick-Joo.

The individuals named in the list are: SPO3 Ricky Sta. Isabel y Molabola, SPO4 Roy Villegas y Levista, PO2 Christopher Baldovino y Bonifacio, Ramon Yalung y Vitug, Alias "SIR DUMLAO", Alias "JERRY", Alias "DING" and other "JOHN DOES".

Ji Ick-Joo was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by the individuals in the said list. Ji's wife Kyungjin Choi filed a case of Kidnapping for Ransom and Serious Illegal Detention against the said individuals.

"This ILBO will ensure that the personnel named therein will not be beyond the reach of our investigating bodies. It will also ensure that these persons are given the chance to present their side of the story when called upon", Secretary Aguirre said.
