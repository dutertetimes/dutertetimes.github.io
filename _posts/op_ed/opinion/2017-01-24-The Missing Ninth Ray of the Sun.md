We have always acknowledged the fight for independence of the famous eight provinces depicted in the sun of the Philippine flag.
These provinces; Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Laguna and Batangas; are honored in our flag.

The ninth ray of the sun of the Philippine flag may come as a surprise to many if not to some.
Is there?
It may have passed our thoughts like some past summer that we try recollecting.

In September 2008, Senator Richard J. Gordon authored a [Senate Bill putting a ninth ray to the sun of the Philippine flag].
He explained:

> This bill proposes that the rays of the sun on the Philippine flag be increased from eight to nine, to symbolize the community of Muslim leaders who defended our land. They are our forgotten heroes, and through this proposal we seek to inculcate in the minds and hearts of our people a just pride in their native Muslim brothers who sacrificed their lives for the country's freedom. For these considerations, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.

A little over a year later the Senate and House of Representatives approved the bill. Senator Gordon said, "This would foster unity, make sure that nobody is excluded. If we are to have national unity in this country it must begin in our flag, it must be symbolized in our flag."[^bill-approved]

Legal counsel of the Bangsa Moro Civil Society and former Vice Governor of Lanao del Sur Atty. Pangnal Datu Ramos said, "The Bangsa Moro people will never forget Senator Dick Gordon's consistent advocacy of recognizing the heroic struggle for freedom of the Bangsa Moro people that led to the approval of the 9th ray in our country's national flag. Senator Gordon displays his statesmanship and respect for the Filipino Muslims, sorely lacking in our national leaders."[^muslim-reaction]

A long-sought recognition turned short-lived.
There was no more mention of the ninth ray of the sun after that.
The news media never followed the story—there was silence.

The stories we know about our past are dim.
"Si Lapulapu"[^lapu-lapu], known as the first native to have resisted Spanish colonization.
"Sultan Kudarat", who united the Muslim clans in Cotobato, Lanao, and Basilan; and led many raids and battles against the Spanish from 1634 up to 1668 and inspired the Maranaos to oppose the building of a Spanish fort near Lake Lanao.
The stories of Kaliph Pulaka, Datu Amai Pakpak, Kapitan Laut Buisan, Sultan Jamalu'l Alam, Sultan Muwallil Wasit, Paduka Batara and Panginan Sarikula, and who knows how many more who all fought against the Spanish.

If one considers the above, our current flag now, without of dishonor, somehow appears to be lacking of representation.
The stars in our flag represents the main island groups of the country; the eight rays of the sun honors the provinces who fought against the colonizers.
So where is the symbol that honors the battles and sacrifices of our Muslim brothers in the south since Ferdinand Magellan came—spanning almost four hundred years?
The ninth ray could represent them.

According to the National Historical Commission[^controversial-flag], the renowned Filipino historian Teodoro Agoncillo pointed out that one of the three stars in the flag already represents the Muslims and the Muslim lands.
We all know that the eight provinces are also already represented in the three stars, as Teodoro Agoncillo pointed—so, why do they have to be in the rays of the sun?
Teodoro Agoncillo statement could be considered like saying the rising of the eight provinces weighs more than the almost four hundred years of Muslim resistance and struggle for independence against the Spaniards.

Some might consider the agreement to the ninth ray of the sun as historical revisionism wherein, I believe, Teodoro Agoncillo might likely concur since he seemed opposed to changing the symbols of the Philippine flag from the original by Emilio Aguinaldo.
Or are those opposed to the recognition of our Muslim brothers' centuries-long fight against the Spanish the one's into historical revisionism?

But it was not the first time that such recognition was sought.
House Bill No. 7725 sponsored by Representative Sultan Omar Dianalan of the 1st District of Lanao del Sur petitioned for the addition of a ninth ray in the sun of the Philippine flag back in 1970s.[^house-bill-7725]
But nothing happened.

We have a long and arduous future to deal with as a people.
The Filipino must be united under one flag where our long and troubled past is wholly represented, recognized, embraced to pursue our aspirations as a nation.

To quote Senator Gordon:

> "With their bravery, our Muslim heroes left an imprint on national history that, at the very least, must be given due recognition in the most heraldic item of national importance—the Philippine flag."
