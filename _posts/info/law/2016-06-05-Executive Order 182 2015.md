A result of the Automotive Industry Roadmap by the private sector and the DTI-BOI, the Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) Program was created to attract new investments, stimulate demand and effectively implement industry regulations that will revitalize the Philippine automotive industry, and develop the country as a regional automotive manufacturing hub.

The thrust of the CARS Program is to provide time-bound, and output or performance-based fiscal support to attract strategic investments in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts.

CARS is intended to augment and enhance existing motor vehicle development programs to ensure the resurgence of the automotive industry that supports innovation, technology transfer, environmental protection, and small and medium enterprise (SME) development. CARS aims to seize market opportunities opened by the ASEAN Economic Community and be more involved in participation in the regional supply chain.
