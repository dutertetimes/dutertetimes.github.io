Rule III. Fiscal Support

SECTION 1. The registered Participants may be entitled up to a maximum of six (6) years of two (2) kinds of fiscal support during the enrolled Model Life, namely: (1) Fixed Investment Support (FIS); and (2) Production Volume Incentives.

SECTION 2. Model Life Budget. The MLB shall not exceed Nine billion pesos (Php 9 Billion).The total fiscal budget support per unit shall be 8% of SWAP but not to exceed Forty-five thousand pesos (Php 45,000.00).

The fiscal support shall be based on SWAP, SPS and LEI during the manufacture of the enrolled Models.

The SWAP shall be determined and fixed by the Board at the time of approval using current NMPs adjusted for inflation averaged over the model life.

SECTION 3. Allocation of MLB. The MLB shall be allocated as follows: (a) forty percent (40%) for Fixed Investment Support and (b) sixty percent (60%) for Production Volume Incentive.

SECTION 4. Fixed Investment Support (FIS). The FIS shall cover capital expenditure (CapEx) for tooling and equipment and training costs for the initial start-up operation. The CapEx to be given the FIS shall be used primarily to support the production of the enrolled models.

The FIS allocation shall be as follows:

a. For manufacturing of Body Shell Assembly and Large Plastics Parts, a minimum of twelve point five percent (12.5%) and a maximum of thirty percent (30%) of the MLB.

b. For Common Parts and Shared Testing Facility, a maximum five of percent (5%) of the MLB.

c. For manufacturing of Strategic Parts, a minimum of five percent (5%) and a maximum of twenty two point five percent (22.5%) of the MLB.

Provided that the FIS entitlements for any project in categories (a), (b), or (c) above shall in no case exceed Forty Percent (40%) of the total CapEx in the investment project.

Priority Strategic Parts and Common Parts are listed in Annex "A" and other parts as may be determined by the Board.

SECTION 5. FIS General Eligibility Requirements. The registered Participant shall be eligible to FIS provided it satisfies the following:

a. New investments in the manufacture of Parts and/or establishment of Shared Testing Facility;

b. Delivery of Parts to the PCM within the prescribed period as stipulated by the BOI;

c. Introduction of the enrolled Model to the market using the Parts manufactured under this Program;

d. Consistently meeting the criteria for enrollment of PCMs; and

e. Attainment of other conditions that the BOI has imposed at the time of registration.

SECTION 6. FIS Eligibility for Body Shell Assembly and Large Plastics Assemblies. Within thirty-six (36) months from the issuance of the Certificate of Registration for the enrolled model, the PCM or its registered parts makers shall manufacture major components of the large plastic parts assemblies and at least fifty percent (50%) by weight of the body shell assembly.

A model registered by a PCM under the MVDP after the effectivity of the EO may also be registered under the Program subject to requirements. In such case(s), the PCM's qualified investments made prior to registration under the Program for the model may be considered for FIS, provided these are declared in the PCM's MVDP application. For this purpose, qualified investments shall refer to new investments in equipment, tooling, training and capital expenditures (excluding land) for the manufacture of body shell parts, large plastic parts, common and strategic parts and the setting up of shared testing services facilities.

SECTION 7. FIS Eligibility for Common Parts and Shared Testing Facility (CPSTF). The PMs and STFOs shall deliver the committed Common Parts and/or service to the PCM within thirty-six (36) months from signing of the agreement for CPSTF.

SECTION 8. FIS Eligibility for Strategic Parts. The PM shall deliver the committed Strategic Parts to the PCM within thirty-six (36) months from signing of the agreement.

SECTION 9. Production Volume Incentive. Production Volume Incentive (PVI) shall be granted based on volume production and logistics efficiency computed as follows:

    PVI = SPS x Actual Annual Production Volume x LEI

a. LEI is a value between zero and one that represents the logistics efficiency of the participating model's parts sourcing computed as follows:

    LEI = Nf - Na
          Nf - Nt

where:

__Nf__ Full CKD pack (m3) = total m3 of parts for one complete vehicle

__Na__ Imported Parts (m3) = annual volume of imported parts (m3) / total annual production (units)

__Nt__ High-technology parts allowance (m3) = total m3 of parts per unit that are classified as high technology parts. The Nt shall be approved by the Board based on enrolled model data submitted by the PCM and an actual physical audit of one lot of full CKD kit, subject to review mid-model life. In no case shall Nt be more than 23% of Nf.

b. The SPS is computed as follows:

    SPS = (60% ­x MLB) / (VolML - 100,000)

Taking the above SPS formula into account, the SPS to be used for the corresponding cumulative production volumes shall be as follows:

+------------------------------+------+
| Cumulative Production Volume | SPS  |
+------------------------------+------+
| 0-100,000                    | PhP0 |
| 100,001 - 200,000            | Lower of PhP54,000 or 9.6% x SWAP |

In excess of actual production volume of 200,000 units within the Model Life, the SPS shall be Php27,000 or 4.8% x SWAP, whichever is lower, until the PVI allocation is fully exhausted.

SECTION 10. PVI Eligibility. PCMs shall satisfy the following conditions to be eligible for PVI availment:

a. Manufacture at least fifty percent (50%) of the assembly by weight in case of Body Shell Assembly;

b. Manufacture major components of the assemblies in the case of Large Plastic Assemblies;

c. Exceed one hundred thousand (100,000) units in production volume; and

d. Meet other conditions that the Board may impose at the time of registration.

The LEI to be used to compute the first PVI availment shall be based on the weighted average LEI after the first 40,000 units.

Rule IV. Funding Support

SECTION 1. Budgetary Support. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM), in coordination with the BOI, shall propose the inclusion of the annual requirements to fund the fiscal support to be granted to registered and eligible PCM under the Program in the annual General Appropriations Act (GAA).

The total fiscal support for the CARS Program shall not exceed Twenty-Seven Billion Pesos (P27 Billion) with each enrolled Model qualified to a fiscal support in an amount not exceeding Nine Billion Pesos (P9 Billion), to be allocated as follows:

a. Forty Percent (40%) for FIS, provided that in cases of Parts and Shared Testing Facility, the FIS shall not exceed 40% of the capital expenditure for tooling and equipment to manufacture the parts, including training costs for the start-up operation for the use thereof; and

b. Sixty percent (60%) for PVI.

SECTION 2. Funds for the Project Management Office (PMO). The DBM shall provide the necessary funds for the operations of the PMO under the BOI budget starting FY 2016 and until the termination of the Program.

SECTION 3. Tax Payment Certificate. The FIS and PVI fiscal support shall be evidenced by non-transferrable Tax Payment Certificates (TPCs), which shall be used to defray the tax and duty obligations due to the National Government. The tax and duty obligations are excise tax, income tax, import duties, and Value Added Tax (VAT) only, and shall not include any type of withholding taxes.

For this purpose, DOF-DBM-DTI-BOI Joint Administrative Order No. 01-2015 entitled, "Guidelines for the Tax Payment Certificate Mechanism to Implement the Fiscal Support for the Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) Program under Executive Order No. 182, Series of 2015" signed on 16 November 2015, shall form an integral part of this IRR.
