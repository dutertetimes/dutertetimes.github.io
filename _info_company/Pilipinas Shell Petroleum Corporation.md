Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (PSPC) or Shell for short is officially known as Royal Dutch Shell is an Anglo-Dutch multinational oil and gas company with its headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands.
It was created in February 1907 through the merger of rival companies, the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company of the Netherlands and the "Shell" Transport and Trading Company Ltd of the United Kingdom.
The merger is largely driven by the need to compete globally with Standard Oil which was established by John D. Rockefeller in 1870.

As of 2016, Shell is the seventh largest company in the world in terms of revenue.
It is also one of the six oil and gas supermajors, also known as Big Oil, which is considered to be BP plc (formerly British Petroleum), Chevron Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, Total SA and Eni.

Shell is vertically integrated and active in every area of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation and trading. It has minor renewable energy activities in the form of biofuels and wind.
Shell operates in 70+ countries with 93,000 employees on average.

Shell has been operating in the Philippines since 1914.
