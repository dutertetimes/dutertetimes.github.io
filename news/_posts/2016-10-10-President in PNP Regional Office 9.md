"Kaya ako dumaan dito just to show my camaraderie with you... I'm just happy to have visited you here," said President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to around 500 officers and civilian staff of the Philippine National Police (PNP) – Police Regional Office (PRO) 9 in a gathering held at the multi-purpose hall of Camp Col. Romeo Abendan in Zamboanga City.

In his keynote address, the President imparted that he loses two policemen a day because of the ‘ongoing and recurring' drug problem in the country.
