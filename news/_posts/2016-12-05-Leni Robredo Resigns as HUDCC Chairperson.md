Vice President Leni Robredo on 5 December 2016 filed her letter of resignation as chairperson of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) after the President asked her to desist from attending Cabinet meetings starting 5 December 2016 because of "irreconcilable differences".

The text of the resignation letter is reproduced here:

> 5 December 2016<br>
> 
> __Rodrigo Roa Duterte__<br>
> President<br>
> Malacañan Palace<br>
> 
> Dear Mr. President,
> 
> I accepted the appointment as Chairperson of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) given our shared commitment to the poor and marginalized.
> 
> I have exerted all effort to put aside our differences, maintain a professional working relationship, and work effectively despite the constraints because the Filipino people deserve no less.
> 
> However, your directive for me to "desist from attending all Cabinet meetings" has effectively made it impossible for me to do my job. Remaining in your Cabinet has become untenable.
> 
> With due respect, I am tendering my resignation as HUDCC Chairperson effective immediately.
> 
> Thank You,
> 
> Maria Leonor G. Robredo


The President accepted Leni Robredo's resignation as HUDCC Chairperson during the Cabinet meeting on 5 December 2016.

The President commented, "It is with a heavy heart that I accept the resignation of Vice President Leni Robredo."

Cabinet Secretary Leoncio "Jun" Evasco Jr., through a statement from Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella, explained the President's decision to accept the resignation.

> Cabinet Members are personally appointed by the President; and it is also his prerogative to withdraw the same for reasons known only to him.
> 
> Cabinet Members accept the appointment with the implicit agreement that they agree with his program, platform and policies.
> 
> While there may be matters they take issue with, these are to be handled consensually because it is vital for the Cabinet to be united.
> 
> It is important that while one is a member of the Cabinet to express one's views discreetly and not be adversarial publicly.
> 
> If in any case a Member finds cause it is his/her prerogative to resign from the Cabinet.
> 
> According to the President, "It is our duty to defend the dignity and integrity of the Filipino people. If Cabinet Members cannot agree with the President's policy they are free to resign."

## Liberal Party

Liberal Party acting president Sen. Francis Pangilinan said that while they are "saddened" by it, they support Robredo's decision.
"We believe the Vice President should have been treated with greater respect. Nakakalungkot ang mga pangyayari," Pangilinan said in a statement.
"Ngayon, mas kailangan natin ang suporta ng mga nagmamahal sa ating demokrasya. Defend Leni, defend democracy," he added.

Sen. Antonio Trillanes had harsher words for the administration. "I'm so glad it did happen sooner than later," he said of Robredo's resignation from the Cabinet. "Otherwise, she would have been tainted by the Duterte Administration's politics of death, divisiveness, deceit and impunity."

Ifugao Rep. Teodoro Baguilat, a member of the Liberal Party said, "It's only right for her to quit the Cabinet because she's no longer welcome in Malacañang. Preventing her from attending Cabinet meetings is already equal to asking her to resign." He added, "The LP must now unite and make a party decision to protect her vice presidency, meaning the LP should break away from the majority coalition. It is an affront to our leadership."
