President Rodrigo Roa Duterte met with the Ilocos Norte government officials for a briefing on the onslaught of Super Typhoon Lawin (International name: Haima) that made landfall on October 19, 2016 (Wednesday) at 11 PM with sustained winds of 225 kilometers per hour (kph) and wind gusts of about 315 kph.

During the briefing, Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos reported that the province has one casualty as the super typhoon hit the place. She attributed this low number to the pre-emptive and forced evacuation implemented by the Ilocos Norte Philippine National Police (PNP), Philippine Army (PA), and Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC). According to the governor, there were a total of 7,814 reported homeless individuals, 579 totally damaged homes, and 7,235 partially damaged homes.

Governor Marcos took the opportunity to address to the President the current needs of the province like the restoration of the Solsona-Madongan River Basin for flood control, food aid, and some equipment for better disaster response such as weather instruments, satellite phones for the PNP, PA, and local government units (LGUs), winches, ropes, rechargeable flashlights, payloaders, and dump trucks.

After the briefing, President Duterte vowed to help the province with its needs.

The President was joined by Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Secretary Judy Taguiwalo, Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Benjamin Diokno, National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Mark Villar, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Director-General Ernesto Pernia, Health (DOH) Secretary Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubial, Agriculture (DA) Secretary Emmanuel Pi√±ol, and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff Ricardo Visaya.

Prior to the meeting, the President went to Tuguegarao City, Cagayan and Ilagan City, Isabela for a ceremonial distribution of Emergency Shelter Assistance (ESA) and relief goods.
