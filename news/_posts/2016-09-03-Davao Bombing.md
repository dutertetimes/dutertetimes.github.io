An explosion at a night market along Roxas Avenue, Davao City on 2 September 2016 blasted around 10:20 p.m. PST killing a number of people and injuring others.
It happened just outside of Marco Polo hotel and a hundred meters away from Ateneo de Davao University (AdDU) where the President frequents.

The blast killed 10 people and as of 2 a.m. of Saturday rose to 14 according to Buhangin Police Station Commander Milgrace Driz in an interview with SunStar Davao.
The death toll is supported by the Davao City Social Services and Development Office as of 10 a.m. of Saturday.
There were 71 confirmed injured: 28 were being treated at Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) hospital, 29 at the San Pedro Hospital, one each at Limso and Brokenshire, 8 at Davao Doctor's, and 4 at the Davao Medical School Foundation.

Immediate suspicion fell on the Islamic State-linked Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), a brutal 500-strong fighters who have launched terror attacks from the Southern part of the country.
The bombing was claimed by the ASG according to its spokesman but the President said that authorities are considering the possibility of involvement of drug syndicates.

The Police Regional Office (PRO) - Davao Director Manuel Gaerlan said, "The PNP is assuring the public that the situation is being handled carefully. A thorough investigation is being conducted to determine the cause of the explosion and checkpoints/chokepoints were already established at all exit points in the city. We call on all the people to be vigilant at all times and report to the police any suspicious packages or persons. Please refrain from creating/passing misleading or unverified reports to avoid confusion and panic." 

Following the incident, the President declared a "state of lawless violence".
"These are extraordinary times... We are trying to cope with a crisis now. There seems to be an environment of lawlessness, lawless violence," Duterte said.
The President clarified that there will be "no curfews" and "no suspension of the writ of habeas corpus".
"I am declaring now a state of a lawless violence in this country. It is not martial law. It has nothing to do with the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus."
The President added, "I am inviting now the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the military and the police to run the country in accordance with my specifications."
"Any punitive or any action taken by security forces would be in furtherance of stopping terrorism. And I am including drugs because of so many killings unfairly attributed to the police, as if they are the handiwork of the police. They do not do that," he said.
"I have this duty to protect the country. I have this duty to keep intact the integrity of the nation," the President added.

Duterte cited that this is not the first time Davao was under the same acts of violence.
He was referring to the twin bombings of 2003 that occured in the Davao airport and the Sasa Wharf that took 39 lives and injured 199 people.

In 2003, former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared a state of lawlessness following the twin bombings in Davao but confined the scope within the Davao region.

The President said, "Government is here with you, as humanly as possible. We will protect everybody... So we also ask the citizens to do their part of being vigilant."

At mid-morning Saturday, the spokesman for the office of the President, Ernesto Abella, issued a statement explaining the basis of the declaration:

> The president's declaration of a state of lawlessness is rooted in Article VII Section 18 of the Constitution which reads:
>
>> Section 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion.
>
> The declaration is limited such that he can only call out the armed forces to suppress the lawless violence.
>
> It is a different case from the existence of invasion or rebellion. Only if there is invasion or rebellion, and when public safety requires it, can he suspend the writ of habeas corpus or declare martial law.
> 
> In the spirit of unity and love of country let us remain alert to the activities of those who wish to create chaos and prayerfully agree for Peace to reign in the land.
>
> It takes a courageous and united people who complain less and do more to build the nation we dream of and deserve.

The President had previously ordered the military to destroy the Abu Sayyaf Group who do terroristic activities and victimizing even the innocent.
