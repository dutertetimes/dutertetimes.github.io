President Rodrigo Roa Duterte administered the recognition to the three The Outstanding Filipino (TOFIL) awardees for 2016 in Malacañan Palace.

The President conferred trophies, medals and plaques to Amb. Jose Cuisia Jr., Dr. William Dar, and Rev. Fr. Antonio Pascual. He cited the exemplary achievements and hardworks of the three awardees that contributed to public welfare and national development.

"The selfless dedication to their profession or vocation has resulted not only to the advancement of their respective fields of endeavor but also to the significant contribution for the betterment of our countrymen and to our country at large," he said.

President Duterte lauded Amb. Cuisia whose financial expertise uplifted the economy of the country when he became the Bangko Sentral Governor. He also served as Philippine envoy to the United States of America (USA) from April 2, 2011 to June 30, 2016 where he was able to enhance the Philippines-United States relations.

The President cited Rev. Fr. Pascual as a respective community leader in different institutions and cooperatives. Rev. Fr. Pascual is also known for providing affordable healthcare, giving accessible loans, and administering self-improvement programs for the marginalized and underprivileged Filipinos.

Likewise, the Chief Executive commended Dr. Dar in being able to feed millions of people by directing the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and other agricultural research institutions to help in providing opportunities and food, not only for the Filipinos but for people all over the world, in India and Sub-Saharan in Africa in particular.

After commending and mentioning the remarkable contributions of the awardees, the President challenged the citizens to emulate their commitment and dedication for the nation to be filled with excellent, extraordinary, and outstanding people.

The TOFIL Award was formed and initiated by the JCI Senate Philippines in the year 1988. It institutionalizes the acknowledgement and recognition for men and women who have dedicated their lives in the service of the nation. The awardees, who are 41 years of age and over, possess achievements that are instrumental to the public welfare and development of the nation.
