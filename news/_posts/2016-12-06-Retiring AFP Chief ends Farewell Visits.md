Retiring Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff General Ricardo R Visaya concluded his farewell visits to field units and saved the best for last in visiting the 4th Infantry Division Headquarters in Camp Evangelista, Cagayan De Oro City, Monday 05 December 2016.

"General Visaya who is known to his fellow officers as 'Bong' was first assigned in the 4th Infantry Division immediately after graduating from the Philippine Military Academy in 1983. He eventually served as the Division Commander from 2013 to 2014," AFP Public Affairs Chief Colonel Edgard A Arevalo disclosed.

The outgoing Chief of Staff was given an arrival honors by the troops of the 4th Infantry Division. He was welcomed by its present Commander, MGen Benjamin R Madrigal Jr.

"I trace the early part of my military career as a Lieutenant in this Division. Little did I know that I will be accorded the chance to command this illustrious 'Diamond' Division." General Visaya said in his speech.

"Many other Generals who occupy key positions in the AFP from the 'Matikas' Class of 1983 trace their roots from this Division. I therefore cannot help but be nostalgic about this unit that has a special place in my heart," General Visaya added.

General Visaya further expressed his gratitude to the men and women of 4ID whom he considered part of what moulded him as a leader. He also advised the troops to continue the string of accomplishments that define what 4ID is named after. 

Earlier that day, General Visaya visited the 1st Infantry "Tabak" Division based in Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur where he was formally received by Division Commander, BGen Gerardo F Barrientos Jr. He succinctly put his counsel to the Officers, men, and women of the division encouraging them to remain professional in their duties. 

"Abuses and other malpractices of the old Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will be things of the past. I will be pleased to retire comforted by the thoughts that I will be leaving behind a more professional, disciplined and modernized AFP," General Visaya said.

"I exhort all of you to remain committed to your calling in defeating all threat groups and be the instruments of change our people deserve," General Visaya concluded.

General Visaya retires Wednesday, 07 December 2016 in a Change of Command Ceremony at the AFP Grandstand in Camp Aguinaldo. President and Commander-in-Chief of the AFP, Rodrigo R Duterte is expected to attend tomorrow's activity.
