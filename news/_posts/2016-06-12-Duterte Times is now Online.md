Duterte Times is an alternative online news about the Philippines.
This is a voice for the Filipino against biased and unworthy news.
Specifically, it will be focused on the presidential term of Rodrigo Roa Duterte, the 16th President of the Republic of the Philippines.

Due to the recent events leading to the media boycott of President-elect Rodrigo R. Duterte, the media and the public will be relying more on the same second hand information coursed through the state-owned media stations.
This may have levelled the playing field and would appear to be a good opportunity to report news alongside the big media companies of the country.
This is an attempt to be in the news media; a far cry from my field.

I am riding on the power of information technology which could soon rival traditional media.
Sources of information are now shifting from a few to the many, tapping on the advances of technology.
Many are already on the internet, the infrastructure for information exchange, and I am hoping to come up with a solution on how to distribute and share information better.
