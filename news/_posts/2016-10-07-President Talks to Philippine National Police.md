President Rodrigo Roa Duterte visits Police Regional Office 13 (PNP-PRO 13) Camp Rafael C. Rodriguez Grandstand, Libertad, Butuan City
October 6, 2016.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte took time on 6 October 2016 to talk to men of the Philippine National Police - Police Regional Office 13 (PNP-PRO 13) at the grandstand of Camp Rafael C. Rodriguez in Butuan City.

Before his speech, the President led the presentation of awards to seven PNP officials for their significant accomplishment on the anti-illegal drugs operation. He was assisted by P/CSupt. Rolando B. Felix, the PNP-PRO 13 Regional Director.

To further encourage and inspire the policemen to strengthen their campaign against illegal drugs in the country, President Duterte gave PhP 250,000 to the best performing offices and stations. Individual awardees were given PhP 200,000 as an incentive.

"It is never wrong for the President, nor the police and the military to protect the citizens," he said to the policemen audience in the event.

In his message, he showed the thick page of compiled matrix that contained the names of public officials and police officers involved in the illegal drug trade. He also stressed that in the war against illegal drugs, the country loses an average of two policemen a day. But this fight, according to him, yields positive implications for the next generation.

"This country must see to it that the next generation must be safe," he added.

Furthermore, the President called on the police force to make the country and their fellow Filipinos the cause of their commitment in fulfilling their mandate.

"I do not ask for your loyalty to me. Stay loyal to the flag and the government," he said.

Apart from illegal drugs, President Duterte warned the police that an imminent threat is brewing, and it is terrorism. Because of this, he encouraged them to further train and reinvent themselves as peace enforcers of the land. Likewise, he said that peace talks with the rebels and insurgents are ongoing.

After his speech, the Commander-in-Chief had a photo opportunity with all the police officers and personnel in the event. Before the program ended, a surprise wedding proposal took place in the presence of President Duterte.
