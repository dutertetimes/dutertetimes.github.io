According to a statement of the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), "The Monetary Board approved the imposition of supervisory enforcement action on RCBC to pay the amount of P1.0 billion, in connection with the special examination conducted by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas relating to the Bangladesh Bank cyber heist."

In February 2016, the Bangladesh Bank was a target of a cyber-attack to transfer US$951 million to bank accounts around the world.
Five bank transfer transactions were granted, US$20 million to Sri Lanka and US$81 million to the Philippines, while thirty more transactions with a total of US$851 million were flagged.
The money transferred to the Philippines was deposited in five separate accounts with RCBC which was later determined to be under fictitious identities.
The funds were later transferred to a foreign exchange broker for conversion to Philippine pesos, returned to RCBC and consolidated into one account.

The Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) filed on March 15 an money-laundering complaint against RCBC Jupiter-Makati City branch manager Maia Santos-Deguito and others before the justice department. The complaint said, for nine months, Deguito failed to verify the identities of the four respondents who opened bank accounts on 15 May 2015. It also said that Deguito have already known of the stop payment request from Bangladesh Bank and that the funds involved are laundered money, but nevertheless allowed the withdrawal to proceed.

The amount is the biggest fine ever imposed by the BSP as administrative sanction to banks and other supervised financial entities for their failure to comply with banking laws and regulations.

BSP said, "This is the largest amount ever approved as part of its supervisory enforcement actions on a BSP supervised financial institution (BSFI). This affirms the BSP’s strong commitment to ensure the stability of the country’s financial system through strong and effective regulation of BSFIs."

RCBC, in a statement, accepted the imposed fine and would settle the payment in two equal tranches, the first half will be paid this year and the other half in 2017.
