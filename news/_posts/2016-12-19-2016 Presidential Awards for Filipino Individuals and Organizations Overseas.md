The President confers Presidential Awards to 23 Outstanding Overseas Filipinos and Organizations on 19 December 2016 held at the Rizal Hall, Malacañan Palace.

Former President Corazon C. Aquino issued Proclamation No. 276 in 1988 declaring the month of December as "Month of Overseas Filipinos" as tribute for overseas Filipinos to encourage their participation in the development activities in the country. Recognizing the significant role of overseas Filipinos in national development, the Philippine government, through the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) conducted various activities to honor overseas Filipinos for their exemplary achievements and contributions.

Former President Corazon C. Aquino in 1991 issued Executive Order No. 498 institutionalizing the awards, naming it the Presidential Awards for Filipino Individuals and Organizations Overseas. The Executive Order specifically designated the CFO and the Department of Foreign Affairs to develop an awards system for Filipino individuals and organizations overseas who have contributed significantly in promoting the well-being of our people, and supporting the country’s development efforts.

There are four (4) categories of awards to be conferred on Filipino individuals and organizations overseas:

* Lingkod sa Kapwa Pilipino (LINKAPIL) Award - This award is conferred on Filipino individuals or organizations for their exceptional or significant contribution to reconstruction, progress and development in the Philippines.
* Kaanib ng Bayan Award - This award is conferred on foreign individuals or organizations for their exceptional or significant contribution to Philippine reconstruction, progress and development, or to advance the cause or promote the interests of overseas Filipino communities.
* Banaag Award - This award is conferred on Filipino individuals or organizations for their significant contribution to advance the cause or promote the interests of overseas Filipino communities.
* Pamana ng Pilipino Award - This award is conferred on Filipinos overseas, who, in exemplifying the talent and industry of the Filipino, have brought the country honor and recognition through excellence and distinction in the pursuit of their work or profession.
