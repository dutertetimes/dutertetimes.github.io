The Office of the Presidential Spokesperson headed by Ernesto Abella issued a response regarding the statement of Vice President Leni Robredo that the Typhoon Nina relief operations were "slow".

The remark Ms. Robredo made saying that the relief operations were "slow" suggests a cynical political mindset willing to capitalize on disaster. One wished she displayed more appreciation of the work of our disaster officials, our social workers, and other volunteers who were on Ground Zero even before Nina made a landfall.

As of January 4, a total of P182,473,574 worth of relief assistance has been provided to affected families in Regions CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, V & VIII, including those who were stranded in various ports in Regions V and VIII. The DSWD provided assistance worth P166,976,473 while LGUs and non-government organizations (NGOs) provided a total of P4,225,832 and P11,271,270, respectively.

The Department of Energy (DOE) with support from local government units and private institutions, on one hand, has brought back electricity to priority areas in Bicol and Southern Tagalog regions before New Year. For transmission facilities in the on-grid area, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), after deploying 500 technical personnel, reported that as of December 31, the Naga-Daraga 230 kV line and the Naga-Pili-Iriga line have been restored servicing the provinces of Albay, Sorsogon and Camarines Sur. Full restoration of NGCP transmission services in typhoon Nina-affected areas is expected today.
