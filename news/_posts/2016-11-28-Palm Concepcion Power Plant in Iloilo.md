Circulating fluidized bed is a new technology for coal combustion designed for low pollutant emission.
It is said that this technology can absorb 95% of pollutants before being emitted to the atmosphere.

The Palm Concepcion Power Plant is one of the most advanced and fuel-efficient coal-fired power plants.
The plant is located in barangay Nipa, Concepcion is located in the northeast shoreline of Iloilo will interconnect with the West (Antique and Iloilo) and North (Capiz and Aklan) Grid.
The 270-megawatt power plant is said to supply power generation capacities to the Visayas grid.
It is covered by an ERC-approved power supply agreement with distribution utilities in Negros, Cebu, Leyte and Panay.

The plant is planned as a two-stage construction, each with a 135MW generating plant utilizing Indonesian coal as primary fuel and local coal as back-up fuel.
The second phase of the plan will commence after six month.
