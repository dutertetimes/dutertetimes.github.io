One of the best ways to combat illegal recruitment is to report their activities.
The Department of Labor and Employment Secretary Silvestre H. Bello III urged concerned citizens to report illegal recruiters who prey on Filipinos seeking better work opportunities overseas.

The secretary said that those who will report illegal recruitment activities to the government which leads to arrest of the illegal recruiters will receive P50,000 as reward.
"Illegal recruitment has to stop and its perpetrators jailed. Sinuman na magbibigay ng impormasyon which leads to the arrest of illegal recruiters, bibigyan ng P50,000 na reward," said Bello.
The P50,000 reward will come from an association of private recruitment agencies.
"Hindi manggagaling ito sa gobyerno. Ito ay mula sa private sector," said Bello.
He explained that the reports will be validated by the concerned offices of the Department.
"May validation pa rin na mangyayari. We also have to take precaution dahil baka naman ma-false alarm kami," he said.
  
"So if ever you find yourself or you know someone that has been a victim, encourage them to report the matter to DOLE," he added.
He added that the public can start reporting illegal recruitment activities once the DOLE 24/7 Hotline is activated.
