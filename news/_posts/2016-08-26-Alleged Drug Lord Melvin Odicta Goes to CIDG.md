Alleged drug lord Melvin Odicta and his wife Meriam met with Interior Secretary Mike Sueño in Camp Crame in Quezon City on 25 August as they feared for their lives.

The couple denied any involvement in illegal drug operations amid the accusation of some people in Iloilo that Melvin is "Dragon," the drug lord in the province.
They said that they have been receiving death threats since July which prompted them to talk to Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief, Police Director General Ronald Dela Rosa as recommended by the Police Regional Director Six. But the couple later decided to talk to Secretary Sueño instead.

Secretary Sueño advised the couple to meet with the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) since they are not local executives and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG). "Hindi kasi sila local executive kaya they are not under the jurisdiction of DILG. They agreed, sabi ko sa kanila why don't you go to CIDG and have themselves investigated," he said.

Secretary Sueño said that the Odicta couple presented documents but they are confidential documents.

In an interview after the press conference, lawyer Raymond Fortun, lawyer of the Odictas, said that his clients are not present in President Duterte's 'list' and that they have nothing to do with illegal drugs.

"The Odictas are just humble businessmen, handa silang magpasubmit themselves to lifestyle check. Lalabas na ang kanilang mga negosyo, yung mga taxi, van, gasoline station, lahat ito ay based on loans with the banks," Fortun said.

Fortun also added that if the couple provided names of people involved in illegal drugs, they would only be personalities in barangays that are involved in illegal drugs. "Kung meron silang ibinigay na ilan ilan, mga personalidad sa barangay na involved sa drugs, pero definitely walang ibinibigay na drug matrix, walang ibibigay na drug matrix kasi wala naman pong drug matrix na alam ang mag asawang ito," Fortun said.
