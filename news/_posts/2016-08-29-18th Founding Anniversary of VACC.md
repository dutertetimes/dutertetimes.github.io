The Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) celebrated their 18th founding anniversary in Malacañan Palace with the theme 'Kabalikat sa Tunay na Pagbabago'.
President Duterte made a speech as their guest of honor.
Senator Koko Pimentel was also in the event.

VACC was founded on 3 August, 1998 by eleven (11) incorporators who composed its first Board of Trustees.
The original officers of the organization were mostly victims of heinous crimes, noted lawyers, civic-minded businessmen and youth leaders led by Dante LA. Jimenez and Lauro G. Vizconde.
