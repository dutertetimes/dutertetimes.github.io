The TOFIL board of judges chaired by Ilocos Norte Governor Imee R. Marcos recognized the following individuals:

"As this year's awardees join the elite circle of the past honorees, may you inspire other people to excel in their chosen fields of experience, to use their skills and talents, their nation-building to effect meaningful transformation that this country direly needs," President Duterte said in his speech.

To the TOFIL winners, he said, "The people we honor here today are one of them, or any one of them, they [have] truly been visionaries, steering their respective institutions and companies in a way that led to advancement of their fields,... at the same time changing lives and changing the difference in our history."
