The makeshift camp of farmers in front of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) in Quezon City was finally dismantled on 22 July after more than four years who are still struggling to own a piece of farmlot for each under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

This camp made of worn out tarpaulins, sacks and bamboo is a place used by picketing farmers from the Pambansang Kilusan ng mga Samahang Magsasaka (Pakisama).
Pakisama voluntarily demolished their makeshift camp "as a gesture of goodwill and support" to the new DAR Secretary, Rafael Mariano or more commonly known to them as Ka Paeng. Pakisama President Rene Cerilla said his group decided to put an end to its four-year-old protest after Secretary Mariano vowed to look into the five major issues the group is fighting for, foremost among which is the 10,000-hectare disputed farm land, currently owned and managed by Danding Cojuangco, that the natives of Bugsok in Balabac, Palawan have been claiming for more than five decades. Cerilla said Mr. Cojuangco gained possession of the vast land through the use of armed men, who bullied, harassed and intimidated local farmers shortly after then President Marcos declared Martial Law in September 1972.

Also in the wish list of Cerilla were: Stop demolition of farmers’ homes in Semirara, Antique, and place under CARP coverage the 100-hectare agricultural land that is included in the 12,200-hectare Aurora Pacific Economic Zone and Freeport in Casiguran, Aurora, the Ysiro landholding in Antipolo, Rizal and the Cagbalite Island in Mauban Quezon.

Cerilla said his group is counting on Secretary Mariano’s inaugural statement that under his watch no farmer would be evicted from the farmlot he/she is tilling.
