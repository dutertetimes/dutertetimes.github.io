The President visited the Provincial Capitol in Virac, Catanduanes on 27 December 2016 after the typhoon Nina devastated the Bicol region and spoke to the local government officials and typhoon victims.

President Duterte was accompanied in the event by Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua, Vice Governor Shirley Abundo, and District Representative Cesar Sarmiento.
Cabinet members that accompanied the President were Department of Agriculture (DA) Secretary Manny Piñol, Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Briones, Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Alfonso Cusi, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Secretary Judy Taguiwalo.

The President enumerated the aid they could provide: Manny Piñol to help ailing farmers whose livelihoods were destroyed by the typhoon; Delfin Lorenzana and the military to handle logistics and other services; Leonor Briones to expedite the rebuilding of school buildings damaged and destroyed; Alfonso Cusi to ensure the speedy restoration of the region's electricity to only two weeks; and Judy Taguiwalo to provide sufficient food, water and other necessities to those stricken by the disaster.

Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) District Engineer Elmer Redrico said that based on the initial assessment of the damages caused by Typhoon Nina, roads were estimated to cost PhP 125 million, national infrastructures including school buildings would cost PhP 150 million, and flood control/sea wall damages would cost PhP 100 million, totaling PhP 375 million.

According to the initial assessment of the Catanduanes Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (PDRRMC), 90 percent of the total population in the province was affected by the typhoon, and no casualties caused directly by the typhoon were found.
