President Rodrigo Duterte welcomed 129 returning Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) from Al Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 2 on 31 August 2016.
To recall, the President ordered the repatriation of stranded OFWs in Saudi Arabia who lost their jobs due to the oil crisis. The President in his message expressed the government's readiness in extending assistance.

For a start, President Duterte said he will be giving the repatriated OFWs PhP 5,000 each as additional financial assistance.
That would be on top of the PhP 20,000 and PhP 6,000 being distributed to them by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).

The President said that the government will be creating jobs through more foreign investors and businesses to provide work opportunities to avoid people from working overseas again. He asked them to give the government a little more time to boost the growth of the Philippine economy.
He emphasizd that it is the economy that really matters even in the issue with illegal drugs.

"Isipin mo lang ang ating bayan parang bola, maraming bukol. Ayos-ayusin natin itong bukol. Ang number one na bukol - ekonomiya. It's usually economy even sa drugs," the President explained.

"We are not so bad naman, ang ekonomiya natin. Maghintay-hintay lang kayo. Bigyan ninyo lang ako ng kaunting panahon, aayusin ko lang ang ekonomiya natin. At nang may opportunity for you to work here," he promised.

He encouraged the OFWs to take advantage of the government's program for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises where they could borrow capital to start a business for the meantime and directed them to consult with the Department of Trade and Industry.

He said that if things are not working out and find themselves in a difficult situation providing food for their families, do not hesitate to approach him.
He said, for the meantime, he would enroll them under the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) until such time they can provide for their families.

"Ganito na lng. Kung talagang medyo hirap ka, even to survive to eat, let me know. Let me know. Kasi kung talagang sarado then enroll ko na lang kayo sa 4Ps. In the meantime we have a little, but yung bigas mo meron ka. Until such time, just don't be a liar, sabihin lang ninyo ang totoo, kung may trabaho na kayo then I'd stop the assistance. In the meantime I'll give it to you. Para sigurado may bigas kayo sa mesa ninyo."

Parting with the OFWs, he said, "Welcome to your country. Tulungan ninyo ako. I welcome you all."

As of the meantime, there are still thousands of Filipinos stranded in Saudi Arabia, but President Duterte said that there is a Philippine delegation sent there for the fast tracking of the repatriation process.
