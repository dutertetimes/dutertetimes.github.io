Before the meeting, Ramos gave President Duterte a copy of the Asian Times Magazine that contained his report on his mission to China. He said in an interview that their discussion with the President centered on this report.

The President had previously requested Ramos to be the Philippines special envoy to China to help in the negotiations to resolve maritime issues in the West Philippine Sea.
