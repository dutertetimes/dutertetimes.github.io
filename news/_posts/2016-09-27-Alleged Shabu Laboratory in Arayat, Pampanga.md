President Rodrigo Roa Duterte inspected the alleged mega shabu laboratory which was discovered and raided this September at Barangay Lacquios, Arayat, Pampanga according to Philippine National Police Region III Director Aaron Aquino.
The facility is said to produce close to 300 to 400 kilos of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) per day, amounting to an estimated worth of PhP 1.5 billion.

The President said that the facility was built during the campaign period and eventually abandoned when he won the presidency.
The land was sold to a certain individual named 'Sunday Chua' who allegedly escaped upon learning that the police team would be raiding the place.

The President ordered the confiscation of the facility and instructed the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) to either completely destroy it or re-use it for industrial purposes. As for the property, he said that the municipality of Arayat could use the land for building a drug rehabilitation center.
