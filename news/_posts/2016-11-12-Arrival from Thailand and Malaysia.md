###### SPEECH OF PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROADUTERTE

###### DURING THE ARRIVAL CEREMONIES FROM HIS VISIT TO THAILAND AND MALAYSIA

###### Davao International Airport, Davao City

###### November 11, 2016

Distinguished co-workers in government, friends, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning.

I am glad to be back from my visits to Thailand and Malaysia.

In Bangkok, I paid respect to a true friend of the Philippines and the Filipino people, His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

His Majesty will be remembered by his dedicated efforts to foster goodwill, mutual respect, and friendship between our nations and peoples.

In Putrajaya, Malaysia, I met with Prime Minister Najib Razak. Our discussion focused on the need to further strengthen the Philippines-Malaysia partnership for a safe and secure and stable region.

As ASEAN brothers and maritime nations, we recognized that cooperation between our countries by the other stakeholders is key to ensure that our sea lanes are not used for illegal purposes or criminal activities.

Earlier this year, we made a headway with the signing of the Framework for Trilateral Arrangement between Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines on immediate measures to address security issues in the maritime areas of common interests.

With Malaysia, we committed to explore all available options to ensure greater collaboration in the joint coordinated pursuit, the interdiction, and the arrest of criminal and terrorist plying the waterways between our countries.

The Philippines is alwaysâ€” will be unremitting in the efforts to address criminality on land, at sea, and between borders.

We also committed to sustain the efforts to achieve just and lasting peace in Mindanao.

As we proceed with the implementation phase of our peace process, Malaysia will continue to play an important role.

The Philippines is ready to work with Malaysia and all partners interested in securing for generations of the Mindanaoans and Filipinos, a future free from fear and conflict.

Malaysia continues to be a partner for growth and development.

My message to business leaders is clear: The Philippines is open for business and we will provide the environment that is conducive for industries to thrive.

Business leaders expressed confidence in many of the opportunities for investment in the Philippines.

They showed keen interest in infrastructure, mass transportation development, building of regional centers, joint ventures in agribusiness, halal-certified products, and high value post-harvest processing facilities.

I tasked the Department of Trade and the Industry to follow through and ensure trade and investment with our 10thlargest trade partner as it continues to grows, and I refer to Malaysia.

As neighbors and friends, we have shared responsibility to ensure that common dignity, particularly the vulnerable, the weak, and the elderly and the youth is upheld.

This is one area that should bring our nations and governments together.

As incoming chair of the ASEAN, we count on Malaysia's support for our efforts to build a stronger, rule-based and people-centered ASEAN.

My visit to Malaysia showed that there are more areas of mutual interests that will bring our countries closer and make us work for the achievement of common goals.

During these two visits, I strived to enhance our relation with our neighboring countries and explore more opportunities to further advance the best interests of our nation.

As I have done in the past, I also met with the Filipino community in Malaysia. I was humbled by their warm welcome.

I reassured them that government will utilize all the resources at its disposal to make our country safe and prosperous place for them to better appreciate and experience once they finally come home to reunite and live with their families.

Maraming salamat po.
