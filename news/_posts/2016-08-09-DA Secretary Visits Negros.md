"I really would go to the provinces to find out what President Duterte and the Department of Agriculture could do to uplift the lives of the farmers and fishers," Secretary Piñol said during his visit to Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental on 9 August 2016.

Speaking before the governors, mayors, farmers and fisherfolk leaders, and other agriculture stakeholders, the secretary discussed his Special Area for Agricultural Development (SAAD) program to alleviate poverty in the top ten poorest provinces in the country.

Piñol stressed that the target of the department to increase fish catch is being supplemented by the agency's efforts to alleviate poverty, thus he asked Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo to identify fisherfolk families that have no fishing boats.
"We will provide two families a fiber glass boat to share, so that they will also share the responsibility of taking care of it," he said.
The bancas are made by the Yolanda survivors from Tacloban as their livelihood.
To further expand the programs for fish and marine product sufficiency, the DA Chief also announced that in the next five years, the government targets to distribute one million fishing boats to fishing families nationwide.

These efforts includes corresponding responsibilities on the part of the fisherfolk to participate in the National Search for the Cleanest Coastal Communities, "Malinis at Masaganang Karagatan" program. The coastal communities should meet the following criteria:

1. absence of illegal fishing;
2. observance of closed season;
3. well-protected marine sanctuary;
4. garbage-free coastal waters; and
5. sustained mangrove protection and rehabilitation program.

The winning coastal communities will receive Presidential Awards and livelihood funds amounting to P10-million, which will be given in December this year.
The coastal communities to achieve all the criteria and top the program will receive Presidential Awards and livelihood funds amounting to P10-million, to be given in December of the current year.

Secretary Piñol also met for the first time with the livestock sector of the Negros Island Region to discuss the department's program.
During the meeting, Piñol stressed that things will change in the Department of Agriculture.
He also assured them, "We will not allow smuggling in the livestock sector."

During the visit, a total of P5.125-million worth of farm machineries and equipment was initially awarded to 12 farmers' associations and two (2) fishermen's associations of the six Local Government Units (LGUs) of Negros Oriental. Also, the Philippine Crops Insurance Corporation (PCIC) distributed P555,431-worth of indemnity checks to 64 rice, corn and livestock farmer-recipients of the Province of Negros Oriental.

The agricultural department chief appealed to the governors and mayors of both Negros Provinces to come up with detailed development plan in their respective municipalities that would identify the interventions they need from the DA.
"Tell us what you need so we can give it to you," Piñol urged.
