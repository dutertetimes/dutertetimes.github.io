The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed several criminal complaints against Senator Leila De Lima and 17 others with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on 10 November 2016 in connection with their alleged involvement in the proliferation of illegal drugs inside the New Bilibid Prison (NBP).

The NBI sued former Justice Secretary, Senator De Lima for the violation of:

* Section 5 and Section 26 (b) of Republic Act 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) in relation to Article 211–A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended (Qualified Bribery);
* Section 27 of Republic Act 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002);
* Section 3 (e) of Republic Act 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act);
* Presdential Decree 46 (Making it Punishable for Public Officials and Employees to receive, and for Private Reasons to Give Gifts On Any Occassion); and
* Section 7 (d) of Republic Act 6173 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees)

Facing complaints for direct bribery and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act 3019, Presdential Decree 46 and Section 7 (d) of Republic Act 6173 are:

1. former Bureau of Corrections chief Franklin Jesus Bucayu
2. former Justice Undersecretary Francisco Baraan III
3. former Bucor officer-in-charge Rafael Ragos
4. De Lima's former security aide and Presidential Security Group Member Joenel Sanchez
5. De Lima's former driver and bodyguard Ronnie Dayan
6. Ragos'close-in aide and NBI agent Jovencio Ablen Jr.
7. Bucayu's alleged bagman Wilfredo Elli
8. DOJ employee Jesusa Francisco
9. De Lima's personal assistant during her DOJ stint Lyn Sagum
10. a certain Julius Rejuso
11. an alias George

High-profile inmates who were included in the charge sheet, specifically in relation to the sale and distribution of illegal drugs which is punishable under Republic Act 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), are:

12. Jaybee Sebastian
13. Herbert Colanggo
14. Engelbert Durano
15. Vicente Sy
16. Wu Tuan Yuan alias Peter Co
17. Jojo Baligad

The charges were filed by NBI spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin and NBI Anti-Illegal Drugs Division chief, Atty. Joel Tuvera.

The complaints were grounded on sworn statements, documents, testimonies of resource persons who participated in the inquiry of the House of Representatives into the alleged illegal drugs in the New Bilibid Prison.

Lavin said, "Klarong sinabi ni Secretary de Lima in one of the meetings in the kubol of Jaybee Sebastian that henceforth, the illegal drug trade in the Bilibid should be centralized or coursed through Jaybee Sebastian." He added, "We have interlocking confessions. Sanga-sanga itong confessions, iyung sinabi ng isa, vinalidate ng isa, ini-corroborate ng isa. We believe we have the case." [^1]

##### Complaint

The NBI said in the complaint that De Lima, during five-year office as DOJ secretary, has failed to fulfill her mandate of ridding the national penitentiary of illegal drugs. The Bureau of Corrections is one of the biggest agencies under the Justice department.

> "Instead of fulfilling this mandate, Senator De Lima effectively brought about, supported and even promoted the proliferation of illegal drugs by conspiring with inmate gang leaders, for the purpose of furthering her political ambitions."

It can be recalled that De Lima claimed to have initiated the much publicized December 2014 raid on the New Bilibid Prison.

> "Although it is true that a raid was conducted, contraband confiscated and prisoners transferred, we are still faced with the quandary of whether that which occurred was an honest and legitimate operation meant to cleanse the NBP of illegal narcotics, or one that was merely staged for the purpose of giving the public the appearance that Senator De Lima took the necessary steps to thwart the drug trade inside the NBP."

The NBI said, "In the final analysis, it is this culture of shameless corruption exacerbated during the terms of Secretary De Lima, Justice Undersecretary Baraan, Director Bucayu and OIC Director Ragos, including all their confederates as named herein, that ultimately led to the opening of floodgates for all kinds of illicit activities inside the NBP, most notably the proliferation of illegal drugs."

Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said the complaint will be consolidated with the other case filed by the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC).
