The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) addressed one of the operational bottlenecks during disaster response through the implementation of the Mechanized Production System (MPS) of the WFP back in 2015.
The Mechanized Production System will provide disaster response with efficient and organized food pack production and distribution.

During the introduction, Praveen Agrawal, WFP Philippines Representative and Country Director, said, "We are pleased to introduce the mechanized production system here in the country." He added, "This will make a huge difference in the aftermath of a disaster as we are now able to significantly expand the number of people to which we can provide immediate life-saving food."

The WFP said that the Philippines is the first and only country to be given a Mechanized Production System.
The MPS is capable of producing 50,000 food packs a day utilizing 100 people compared with 4,500 people packing only 15,000 food packs a day.

Also during the introduction of the MPS in September 2015, Asif Ahmad, UK Ambassador to the Philippines, said, "We learnt some important lessons as we mobilised relief for the victims of Typhoon Yolanda." He added, "Speed is of the essence in delivering essential survival requirements to people in desperate situations following a natural disaster. This UK government-supported programme will mean that food in the right condition will be delivered quicker and more efficiently."

The first MPS was built in Pasay City on September 15, 2015.
The second was put up in Cebu City on April 26, 2016.
According to WFP, two will be in place in Clark, Pampanga and in General Santos City by 2016.

The WFP Mechanized Production System is funded by the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom.
