The President graced the Urban Poor Solidarity Week 2016 spearheaded by the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor on 7 December 2016 at the Hardin ng Pag-asa, Barangay Addition Hills, Mandaluyong City.
This year's theme is 'Partnerships for Change with the Urban Poor'.

The UPSW celebration is in accordance with Proclamation No. 367 signed in 1989 that aims to promote "greater understandings on the issues and problems of urbanization, urban poverty, informal settlements and other related concerns."

According to PCUP Chairperson Terry Ridon, the immediate relocation of the super typhoon Yolanda victims, especially those situated at the 'no-build zones', is currently underway. The Commission, he said, will also be the one to facilitate the dislocation assistance for those who are affected by the ongoing Water Waste Clearing Project, wherein each family will receive PhP18,000 as aid.

Moreover, PCUP recently launched the Urban Poor Kontra Droga program that aims to have a community-based rehabilitation for all affected individuals and families in support of the government's war against illegal drugs.

Also present during the program were Executive Secretary Salvador C. Medialdea, Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Secretary Judy M. Taguiwalo, Mandaluyong City Lone District Representative Alexandria P. Gonzales, Mandaluyong City Mayor Carmelita A. Abalos, former Mandaluyong City Mayor Benjamin D.C. Abalos, and Barangay Addition Hills Captain Kent G. Faminial.
