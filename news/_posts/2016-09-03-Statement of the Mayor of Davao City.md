Statement of Mayor Inday Sara Duterte-Carpio on the Friday Night Blast in Davao City

I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of those who died last night.

I would also like to reassure all of them, as well as the families of those who are injured that the City Government of Davao will assist in all their needs for hospitalization, burial, funeral and day to day expenses.

I am sorry for what happened.

I would like to remind other officials to stay within the bounds of their official duties according to their position. Please leave me in peace to do my job and I'll leave you to focus on your own work.

We will not be terrorized by this heinous crime and I call on all Dabawenyos to unite and let us help each other rise from this senseless incident.

Let us remain vigilant, please report any and all suspicious activity, no matter how insignificant it may seem.

There will be a memorial at 4:00 this afternoon at the explosion site. Everybody is welcome to say their prayer, lay their flowers and light a candle for those who passed.

Thank you.
