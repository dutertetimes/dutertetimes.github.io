Oath Taking of Malacañang Press Corps (MPC), Malacañang Cameramen Association (MCA) and Presidential Photojournalists Association (PPA) in Heroes Hall, Malacañan Palace on 26 September 2016.

Bakit sila, ang america and britain, they warned iraq, i do not know what was that warning, but they went inside iraq on a pretext excuse and reason that there were weapons of mass destruction.
Only to find out that there was none.
And yet they destroyed the nation.
Paka-hipokrito nitong...
Itong EU, at first you have the pretension of a the sentiments of civilizatioin, binuksan ninyo yung boundary

Here I am killing the criminals assuming it to be true.
You guys...
What the hell happened to your values in life?

Itong mga writers dito, they keep on hammering

Ladies and gentlemen of the Republic of the Philippines, our problem now is not my mouth.
It's drugs, numbering about 3 million, plus the new surrenderees of seven [hundred thousand].
You cannot help it by just listening to my epithets, my slurs, and my curses.
They are nothing.
They are but manifestation of the anger inside me.

For it not for my love of country, alam mo kung bakit?
Deep down, deep down I knew na ako lang makaresulba dito [illegal drugs].

If you really want a trial, if you want a show, a razzle-dazzle, then let us go to court.

Eh hinihiya mo ako, eh di magkahiyaan tayo.

Gusto ko everybody should be placed under oath so that if in the end I can establish that you are lying, I can proceed against you for a vindication.

Kung makinig ka lang, mag-notes lang kayo, tapos kunin n'yo iyung garbage ni De Lima, that's bullshit.

I told them, you know guys, I am a president, I am you commander-in-chief, that's a title for war.
Unfortunately, I am not a war time president.
My main job, my main task really is to seek peace for my land.
That is why inuna ko na yan sila.
Even before I assumed office


Which I would like to tell the nation now - No.
I will not talk peace with the Abu Sayyaf.
Masyado ang -
Everytime you do that, it's like slapping the nation.
Hinihiya mo kami.
And you did it even during my time.
And the last time was just a child.
Hindi naman milyonaryo yung - 
It's not even odious, I can describe - despicable.
It is really a despicable ideology.
Hindi pwede yan.
So balikan ko yan.

I will submit to any investigation.
Provided

Find something here that you can be charged because if it is not a criminal offense then any other country cannot term it or cannot categorize it as a crime.
I am a citizen of this republic. The crimes and felonies are in our books.
If it does not say anything about my criminal liability -
Before international law there is the constitution which is the bed rock.

"Sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose."

Kung lahat ng countries takot sa inyo, mga putang ina kayo, ay hindi ako takot sa inyo.

I have talked to Xi Jin Ping.
I'm going to China.
I will open up all avenues of trade and commerce.
They can come in, but there is no time yet to amend the constitution, then and I can give them 60 years plus another 60 years.
By that time you won't need your factory here already.

It's a matter of principle for me that my land should only be for my people.

And I said, 
I think I'm about to cross the Rubicon between me and the United States, at least for the six years.
I would need your help and everything; trade, commerce, and I will open up.

You observe not even respect.
You observe not even courtesies.
Lahat kayong malalaking negosyo, specially serving the public, observe humanity.
