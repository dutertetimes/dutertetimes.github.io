President Rodrigo Roa Duterte addressed anew his local and foreign critics amidst the government's campaign of suppressing the current crime rate in the country. 

Speaking before the men and women of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Police Regional Office (PRO) 12 at its headquarters in General Santos City, the President admitted that it would be a long way for the Philippines to totally destroy the threats brought by criminality such as illegal drugs, kidnapping, murder for hire, etc. but assured them he has his ways to control these acts. 

To all of his critics, the President stressed that they either respect his decisions or stop interfering with his means of leading the country. He reiterated, "If you just treat me fairly, nagpapakumbaba ako."

He cited Davao City as an example of what can be achieved if discipline is implemented.

"Bakit sa Davao nahinto iyong droga?... Bakit ang Davao naging one of the safest cities in the world? Bakit ang Davao ang negosyo pumasok at nakita? Bakit ang Davao ang mga tao doon medyo disiplinado, walang suplado?," he emphasized. 

Also, he repeated his call for the postponement of the barangay elections, citing narco-politics as the main reason why he is in favor of rescheduling it. The President believes that local politicians in the barangay level are involved in illegal drugs. 

To honor the endless dedication and commitment of every policemen and women to their sworn duty, President Duterte bestowed several awards such as the Medalya ng Kadakilaan, Medalya ng Kagalingan, at Medalya ng Kasanayan. Apart from the honors, the Commander-in-Chief promised that each of the awardee would receive PhP 250,000 as cash gift.
