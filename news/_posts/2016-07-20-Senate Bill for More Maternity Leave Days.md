Akbayan Senator Risa Hontiveros has filed Senate Bill No. 205 or otherwise known as the 'Expanded Maternity Leave Law of 2016' seeking to advance a longer maternity leave and expand the benefits of maternal workers.

The proposed bill aims to be 'responsive to the everyday realities of working women,' according to Hontiveros.

It hopes to provide maternal workers in the public and private sectors 120 days of maternity leave and an additional 30 days for single mothers.

The current maternal leave law in the Philippines states that women may take a maternity leave of 60 days with pay and 78 days with pay for women who undergo caesarian deliveries.
Whereas, the International Labor Organization (ILO) mandates a standard _minimum_ set of 98 days for maternity leave.

"The government must carry a new and progressive perspective on how it responds to women workers’ pre and post-natal health care needs," said Hontiveros in her statement.
