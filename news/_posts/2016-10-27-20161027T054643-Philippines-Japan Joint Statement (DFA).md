The two leaders affirmed Japan's significant contributions over the years to the efforts of the Philippines to strengthen its maritime capabilities through human resource development, capacity-building assistance and provision of patrol vessels and other equipment for the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), taking into account the long history of cooperation between the Japan Coast Guard and the PCG. On that basis, they shared the intention to further cooperate in various areas of common interest for maritime security and safety.

The two leaders welcomed the signing of the Exchange of Notes on Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) Loan for the two large-scale patrol vessels to the Philippines as well as the steady progress in the provision of ten patrol vessels, which Japan had already decided to provide.
