President Rodrigo Roa Duterte restored the unilateral ceasefire the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)/New People's Army (NPA)/National Democratic Front (NDF), effective 12 a.m. August 21, 2016.
The operational guidelines of the ceasefire declaration for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police and other security units of the government are also restored.

In a statement read by Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) will implement the ceasefire the duration of which will last for as long as necessary to bring peace in the land and also in order to provide an enabling environment for the success of the peace negotiations in Oslo, Norway starting August 22.

The Duterte government will walk the extra mile for peace, said Dureza, who held a press briefing before flying to Norway.
