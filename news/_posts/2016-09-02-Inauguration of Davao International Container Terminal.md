Note: Video presentation starts at 21:20.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte inspected the newly installed Berth 2 station of the Davao International Container Terminal (DICT) in Panabo Port, Davao del Norte.

Completed in July 2016, the Berth 2 is hoped to double its annual capacity to more than 70,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU)—the ship’s cargo carrying capacity. The DICT also boasts to be the most modern container port terminal in the Philippines located at the crossroads of major agricultural plantations that would increase import and export goods in Mindanao.

Joining him during the inspection were Davao del Norte 2nd District Representative Antonio Floirendo Jr., ANFLO Management and Investment Corporation (ANFLOCOR) President Alexander Valoria, Panabo City Mayor James Gamao, EastMinCom Commanding General Lt Gen Rey Leonardo Guerrero, Philippine National Police (PNP) Regional Director P/C Superintendent Manuel Gaerlan and other DICT officials.
