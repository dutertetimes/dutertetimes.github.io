###### PRESS CONFERENCE OF PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE

###### DURING THE DEPARTURE CEREMONY FOR A THREE-DAY WORKING VISIT TO JAPAN

###### Terminal II, Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Pasay City

###### October 25, 2016

Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea; members of the Cabinet present here, General Ricardo Visaya and the Major Service Commanders; General Manager Eddie Monreal; Congresswoman Imelda Calixto-Rubiano; Mayor Antonio Calixto; fellow workers in  government; my beloved countrymen: 

I leave for a three-day official visit to Japan. This official visit will be a valuable opportunity to further deepen and broaden the Philippines relationship with Japan, our valued strategic partner and one of our true friends. It is a visit that is most awaited. I look forward to meeting Prime Minister Abe again in Tokyo. His warm invitation extended at the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting in Laos paves the way for discussion of key issues of mutual importance to our countries and people.

We will discuss among others, greater political, social and defense cooperation particularly in   maritime domain awareness and maritime security. With Japan as the Philippines top trading partner I shall seek the sustainment and further enhancement of our important economic ties. I look forward to meeting business leaders in Japan, I will tell them clearly that the Philippines is open for business. 

To support the Philippines sustained growth and development, I shall seek to open more avenues of cooperation in key infrastructure development. In particular we can tap the experience and expertise of Japan in developing high quality and modern public transportation. The visit will be an opportunity for me to personally thank Japan for its pre-eminent and fearless role as the Philippines' development partner. 

I shall seek the strengthening of this role thru more high impact projects that will benefit our nation. Mindanao will be a central focus as together with Japan we shall seek to put on track these island regions towards a just and lasting peace and development. I shall also meet the leaders of the Japan-Philippines Parliamentarian Friendship League to seek greater interaction between the collaboration by our legislators to a common agenda.

This is an important time for Philippines-Japan relations as we advance an independent foreign policy in our engagement with the community of nation. This is a defining moment for the solid and strategic partnership between Japan and the Philippines carefully nurtured over 600 years of formal diplomatic relations. 

During this visit, I am honored to pay a courtesy call on His Majesty the Emperor. This courtesy calls is imbued with great and special significance. It reaffirms at the highest level, the positive transformation of ties between our nations and peoples. It denotes our shared commitment to a forward looking partnership that is founded on mutual respect, dignity and solidarity. 

It will capture in one moment, the full range of our relations with a country that is kept at high regard and definitely deserves its unique place. Ours is an abiding partnership with Japan. It is based on common aspirations and shared values of democracy, adherence to the rule of law and the peaceful settlement of disputes. I seek to advance our national interest in this official visit to Japan. I will remain true to my sworn oath as your President. 

Maraming salamat po.

I can---about a few questions media ----just to assuage your hunger for—

SEC. ANDANAR:		Mr. President, our first question is from Hataw Rose Novenario.

ROSE NOVENARIO/HATAW:		Good morning, Mr. President. Posibleng po bang pag-uusapan ninyo sa inyong pagbisita sa Japan ang Visiting Forces Agreement with Japan?

PRRD:				Again?

ROSE/HATAW:			Posible po bang pag-usapan ninyo sa pagpunta ninyo sa Japan iyong pagbalangkas ng Visiting Forces Agreement with Japan?

PRRD:				No. I don't think so. I do not believe that we have a Visiting Forces Agreement with Japan. To my mind, I maybe wrong, but I have yet to come across an agreement or a piece of paper which says that we are... in this arrangement of Japanese troops. Military troops as you mean visiting my country. As a matter of fact, I said, in our it's Section 7, I forgot the Article... the Constitution mandates that the government of the  Republic  of the Philippines shall pursue an independent foreign policy. And to that extent, I would like to say this with all candor, I look forward for the time when I no longer see any military troops or soldiers in my country except the Filipino soldier. 

Hangarin ko po iyan na wala na akong makitang sundalo sa ibang bayan kung hindi iyong sundalo ng Pilipinas.

ROSE/HATAW:			Thank you po. Second question po. Sa napipipinto po ninyong pagpunta sa APEC Summit sa November 19 to 20. Sa palagay po ba ninyo ay mas maipapaliwanag ninyo ang inyong independent foreign policy at ang drug war na isinusulong po ng inyong administrasyon?

PRRD:				Well, I said I do not have to dovetail what the policies of our countries are and especially in the matter of stationing of the military troops in my country. I really hate it and I don't want it, we don't need it. We are not going to war and there's not going to be any war in the future.

MAKIKO SIGAWA/TV TOKYO:		Thank you so much for accommodating. I'm Makiko Sigawa of TV Tokyo. First question: what emotion, what motivation in feeling you carry for Japan, because you are about to leave for Narita Airport, Tokyo.

PRRD:				Even as I take off today, this afternoon, just seeing you in my country asking question is the beginning of a great expectations and joy. I go to Japan with full trust that we can understand each other and Japan would understand my position vis-à-vis with the foreign policy that I want to implement. It's just a question of a policy that is really truly Filipino.

MAKIKO SIGAWA/TV TOKYO:		Second question so far. In Japan the many media talking  about diplomacy, attitude of diplomacy if you have more for China or for Japan and can you tell me the truth  why you like more Japan, why you like more China, okay?

PRRD:			Can you translate.

SEC. ANDANAR:		Mr. President, she is asking if you love Japan more or you love China?

MAKIKO SEGAWA/TV TOKYO:	(Laughs)

PRRD:			Between China and Japan, I think I love the Philippines more. (applause/cheers)

MAKIKO SEGAWA/TV TOKYO:	Which do you like, a Jollibee or McDonalds?

PRRD:			Frankly, I do not eat... really, truly. Seldom, very often but I always stick to bibingka and maruya, native dish. 

TUESDAY NIU/DZBB:	Good morning, Mr. President. Tuesday Niu of DZBB. Sir, General Dela Rosa stated yesterday that he submitted already to you the list of narco-celebrities. And he said that mas marami raw po iyong nakasulat sa listahan ninyo. Do you plan of announcing it, sir, to the public katulad noong ginawa ninyo doon sa mga narco-generals, sa narco-politicians? 

PRRD:			Okay. I'll be frank with you, everybody. The final list submitted to me by the law enforcement agency, ganoon ho kakapal. Hindi ko malaman ngayon kung paano ko mahanapan ng solusyon. This thick, there are about a thousand policemen involved in drugs. There are about almost a thousand barangay captains already in the business of shabu. There are about few mayors and national officials. What I'm trying to say is I will call maybe for a consensus dito sa itaas. Lahat ng mga senators, congressman. 
					
Kasi nagpakabigat ho ng problema na ito, at kung ako lang sasabihin ko pero hindi ko kaya. Kasi... hindi ko kaya. I mean... ano gawin ko dito, patayin ko lahat? At nandiyan na naman 3,000 – it's about almost a ten thousand network spread all throughout the Philippines. And with the election of De Lima to the Senate using money from drugs, the portals of the national government has been opened to narco-politics. 
					
May problema ho ang Pilipinas. Ito iyong problema nakatago noon all these years until I became President at pinuga ko lahat, lumabas na. Alam ng military iyan, alam na ng pulis. Kaya sabi ko nga sa kanila minsan, "Oh ito, trabaho man ninyo iyan. What do you propose to do?" Isa-isahin mo iyan i-prosecute – impossible dream. We cannot—pasundan mo araw-araw iyan. But they are really validated, some of them judges. It has affected the entire gamut. 
					
Hindi ko talaga—ni ako, sanay ako niyan. Kung sa Davao maliit na ano, but mismo ako, I must admit hindi ko alam gaano kalawak. How widespread it is or what until I became the President of this country. 'Di ko sukat akalain na ganoon kalalim – by the hundreds of thousands. And three years ago, General Santiago said that there are three million drug addicts already. I did not consider my list, because until now there are people surrendering. At by the end of this year, I would have breached the four million mark.
					
Kaya ang Indonesia, sabi ni President Widodo they have four million. But remember that Indonesia is a big country, it's about three/two islands, big islands and it has a population of 240 million. Ang akin mas maliit na islands, 7,000 pieces of islands and I have 110 population with the 4 million headache. Tulungan ninyo... ewan ko anong gawin natin diyan. Ang pinakamabilis na mga rehab ang nagawa, ang China. One is in Fort Magsaysay, it can house ten thousand. Another Chinese foundation is building like another 20,000 in Mindanao. But for the million that would be needing treatment, else they go back to where they belong – and that is using and pushing shabu. 
					
The problem is, until now Regions I, II and III... araw-araw my sweat... like a flotsam... mga kaldero, mga aluminum na may shabu. Those were manufactured, niluluto in ships, in international waters then kung ready na sila, they just go by the side of the... our territorial limits at hinuhulog nila. Ganoon kabigat ang problema ng Pilipinas. 
					
Four million will affect certainly this generation. Itong generation na 'to, iyong anak ninyo pati iyong mga apo ninyo, may tama iyan if you are not careful. And only if you are there to guard them every moment of their lives until they are responsible enough to know what is fundamentally wrong. For after all, shabu has infected even soldiers and doctors and lawyers. 
					
Ganoon kabigat ang problema, and you know I had a talk with the—and I agreed to just... kay Bong. I don't know why but, I had a talk with Secretary Yasay and here is a guy, his name is Russel... if you can just tone down our rhetoric's. Alam mo hindi ako nag-una nitong away na 'to eh. Ang nag-una sila. Remember, iyong punu't dulo nito ano? Iyong eleksiyon, I made a comment, a narration of an actual event which happened in Davao and which was covered by all media outlets there. Tapos the Ambassador said something not very nice. You are not supposed to do that, because in an election of another country, you should be careful with your mouth.
					
I reacted into it, at it started to go out of control until they threatened me with imprisonment kasi human rights violation. And most of all, bakit ako nagmura? Just to show na bastos rin ako. Alam mo bakit? They were threatening me - because it was an issue, it was a yellow fever issue sa eleksiyon. It was not an issue against me. In the early days of the campaign, when I was hitting hard sa rating and there was this looming... well, they started the hogwash. A senator whose foot is in his mouth. Eh, good-for-nothing... 
					
Tapos sila ang nag-umpisa na be careful, lumabas iyong Human Rights, State Department, Obama, EU. Ginanoon ako, and everytime they said "We will cut our assistance." Sabi ko sa kanila, "Putang ina ninyo. Huwag mo kaming gawing aso." Do not... you know, sabihin mo na as if I am a dog with a leash, tapos magtapon ka ng pan doon sa malayo, hindi ko maabot. Sila iyong... you review, all that I need was—alam mo bakit? Walang nakikinig eh. I was trying to say na ganito, ganito... that hindi iyong 3,000 na iyan mga ulol kayo, hindi lahat gobyerno iyan. 
					
May pinatay ang gobyerno on legitimate encounters. But it doesn't mean to say that the 3,000 parang pinalabas nila na wala nang ginawa ang gobyerno, except to, iyong state-sponsored killing. Binastos ang bayan ko, hindi ako... sanay ako pulitiko ako. And so what kung hindi sila bilib sa akin, hindi naman ako bilib sa kanila. What if magsabi every time that they make a comment about iyong human rights, which is really sinasakyan ng mga gago dito. Pinapalaki nila. Maybe itong elite, pati itong mga mayaman sa mundong ito dito sa Pilipinas ayaw sa akin. Eh letse kayo, ayaw ko rin sa inyo.

Eh kahapon tumawag si Secretary Yasay, nandito raw ito siya, ang sabi ni... nag-usap daw sila, sabi niya 'if you can just tone down our rhetoric against America.' Sabi ko wag ninyo akong ganunin, every time sabihin they threaten us, pati itong EU. Akala mo mas bright kayo sa atin. Tapos sabihin, be careful, we will put you in prison. P****ina subukan mo.

Now, what did I do to China? I went there just being, oh tingnan mo ang lumabas - Duterte sparks international threat. Tang-ina kaliit-liit kong tao, bakit ba kayo mag-stress, nerbyoso kayo. Kasi guilty. Wala naman ako ginawa sa China, nag-usap kami. And so there's a lot of speculation. Sabi ko look at Section 7 Article, it states there very clearly. I urge every one of you - that the Philippines shall follow an independent foreign policy and putting at most of the time the best interest of the nation. Sinunod ko lang iyon, pero ang bunganga nerbyoso – "Duterte sparking internationals distress."  Paki-alam ko sa Africa. Di ba International.

Ayaw ko na sana, pero nung nabasa ko ngayong umaga. I promised the Secretary, I won't ...pero nung nabasa, sabi ko itong mga Amerikano buang talaga. The style, tingnan mo maglakad dito kala mo sino. Wala pang mga visa itong mga gagong ito. Tayo magpunta doon pahirapan pa. At may sabi pa raw galit ako, kasi hindi ako kumuha, hindi ako binigyan ng visa.

I'll tell you my answer. The first time I went to America ito ang question ng Consul: "Why are you going to America?" I said to visit a girlfriend, yeah, yes. Tapos sabi niya, "what if you decide to marry the girlfriend and you do not go back here in the Philippines." Sabi ko, "Mr.  Consul, even if you grant me a multiple lifetime visa and even if you give $50,000. I will not go there anymore. I'll stay here in the Philippines." 

Hindi ako hangol ng bayan na, maski gaano kahirap natin, di magtiis tayo. Do not dangle me about America. What is there—nagkagulo-gulo na nga kayo doon eh. Why should you go there magtanong ka ng mga Pilipino doon, mga doktor, magtanong ka ng mga sundalo na nag-aral doon, it's pure bigotry and discrimination doon. Magtanong ka ng napunta---kasi bayan nila. Sabi niya separate, separate yes, you have the EDCA, well forget it. If I stay a long enough, one day that EDCA will, if it is an executive agreement then I will—

I do not want to see any military man of any other nation except the Philippines soldiers, iyan lang ang gusto ko. That's the long and short of it. I want an independent policy, that hindi ako pasunud-sunod maski kanino. Walang---sabi ko wala na, tahimik na ako. Russel says Duterte comments causing worries in business communities, di magsilayas kayo, magtiis kami, we will recover I assure you. We will live and survive. We have gone to the worst of times in this planet.

Tapos isang comment niya RP-China re-approachment should not come at the expense of the US. Napakabilis ng malisya ng mga gago, wala aming pinag-usapan na China kung hindi paano magluto ng siopao na maganda pati chopsuey. Eh kung may ibigay ang China, di pasalamat, eh di wala di wag.  

Ito naman, Goldberg says US remains strongly committed to the defense of the Philippines. There will be no wars anymore. Sino ang makigiyera sa atin, China? What will they get? Japan? Anong defense, baka ---- they want to talk about the boogieman of war. Stop that shit. Nobody is interest with the wars anymore. And if there is you fight, you fight your wars, do not include mine. You are in the time when Manila was to be taken back by the allies, they carpet-bombed Manila, hindi ang Hapon, sila, they come backing American forces, 200,000 died here. Ang Manila talaga flattened just in two days of bombing plus the massacre.

You know, before we can move forward Mr. America there are things, so many things. The massacre of the Filipino people before, these are historical hurts that would never go away, depende na lang kung maka-presidente ang Pilipinas ng tuta ninyo. You count me out. I'm not one of them. I am not also a tuta of any country. Mind you, only ang puwede lang mag-tuta sa akin ang Pilipino, period. Walang iba.           

So that's my parting statement. Yes. Pag hindi ako pina-land ng Japan, balikan kita dito.

JOSEPH MORONG/GMA-7:		Just complete, sir, iyong thought ninyo about EDCA. Are you close to rescinding it, because you mentioned you want to see nobody except the Filipino soldiers on the... our soil.

PRRD:			Well ito pumunta itong—maybe to talk to me. Dito mag-usap kami, dalawa lang kami sa isang kuwarto. I don't want anybody else. Gusto ninyo mag-ganoon kayo sa plywood, pakinggan ninyo kung paano ako.

JOSEPH MORONG/GMA-7:		Sige, sir, thank you.

SEC. ANDANAR:	Thank you so much, Mr. President. Thank you so much media. Let us all greet our President a very, very fruitful trip to China.
