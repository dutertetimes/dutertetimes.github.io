President Rodrigo Duterte declared July 15, 2016(Friday), as a special non-working holiday in the Cordillera Administrative Region in celebration of its 29th foundation anniversary.

Malacanang issued Proclamation No. 08 today declaring July 15 as a special non-working holiday “to enable the people of the Cordillera to celebrate the occasion.”

“It is but fitting and proper that the people of CAR be given full opportunity to celebrate and participate in the occasion with appropriate ceremonies,” the proclamation states.

This year’s celebration theme is “CAR @ 29: Working together for an Autonomous and Empowered Cordillera.”

The Cordillera Day celebration kicked off with the Kapihan sa Baguio media forum last June 29, was followed by various activities in the region.  It will have its highlights on July 15 with a parade to be participated by the different officials and delegates of the six provinces and the cities of Baguio and Tabuk along the main thoroughfares of Baguio City to the Baguio Convention Center for the main program.

The Cordillera Unity Gong Relay now on its fifth year, also kicked off in the City on July 9 and  is  going  around  the  different provinces of Cordillera to sound the call for support and strengthening of ties of local government units and communities towards the  attainment of regional autonomy , and economic growth and progress.

Spearheading  the  celebration this year is  Department of Social Welfare and Development,  chair of the Regional Development Council’ s  Social Development Committee with Baguio City as the host local government unit.

The Cordillera Administrative Region composed of Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, Mountain Province and Baguio City was created thru Executive Order 220, which was signed by President Corazon Aquino on July 15, 1987.
