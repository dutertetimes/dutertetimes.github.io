"I was a synthetic farmer, having been the grandson of a Batangas farmer, but Ka Paeng is the real farmer," Virgilio de los Reyes admits during the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) turnover ceremony on 5 July 2016.
Outgoing DAR secretary was referring to incoming DAR secretary Rafael Mariano also known as Ka Paeng.
Mariano is a founding member and former chair of the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP).
He was also President of Anakpawis party-list and chair of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan).
Rafael Mariano is the first and only true-blooded farmer to sit as DAR Secretary.

Mariano plans to convene within the month the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) which under the previous Aquino administration never met even once.
He also announced his plan to boost the morale of DAR employees and recognized those workers at the lowest levels.
He said he will seek suspension of the rationalization order in which more than 869 positions were invalidated that caused dismay among employees.
He also plans to strengthen inter-government connectivity programs with the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).

Anakpawis and KMP members who were invited in the event raised clenched fists in victory when Ka Paeng announced an open-door policy in the once-heavily guarded bureaucracy. He reminded everyone the reason why DAR has the mandate: it is because of the farmers, he noted.

With his open door-policy, rallies will grow and strengthen in support of Genuine Agrarian Reform Program (GARP).
He urged DAR employees to welcome farmer groups and to assist them in their concerns.
Echoing President Duterte's inaugural speech, Ka Paeng said he is also ready to go to work. (DAR)
