President Rodrigo Roa Duterte talked to the Philippine National Police – Police Regional Office X (PNP-PRO X) troops at Camp 1Lt. Vicente G. Alagar, Lapasan in Cagayan de Oro City on 22 September 2016.

Prior to his speech, the President administered the conferment of the Medalya ng Kadakilaan to Iligan City PO Intelligence Officer P/Supt. Arniel Agustin Catarata; Criminal Investigation and Detection Group X (CIDG X) Regional Chief P/Supt. Tom Tuzon; and Cagayan de Oro City Police Station III Commander P/CInsp. Ariel Philip Pontillas.

Catarata was awarded for his successful anti-drug operation in Barangay Tubod, Iligan City that led to the captivity of Jose Booc, Jr., a big time illegal drug supplier. On the other hand, Tuzon and Pontillas were able to capture Rayhana Batara Y Ali, also known as Sandor Osop Sumagayan or "Konsehal," in a buy-and-bust operation at Agora in Lapasan, Cagayan de Oro City. This operation resulted to the confiscation of two big packs of shabu weighing about 200 grams.

Furthermore, plaques of recognition were conferred on the following: Iligan Ciy Police Office as the unit with the highest volume of confiscated illegal drugs; Bukidnon Police Provincial Office for garnering the highest number of those who surrendered; Misamis Oriental Police Provincial Office for ranking number one in the evaluation rating and having the most number of house visitations; and Cagayan de Oro Police Office for having the most number of police operations and cases filed. The awards covered the operations during the "Double Barrel," an Anti-Illegal Drugs Campaign Project from July 1 to September 15, 2016.

After the awarding, President Duterte vowed to give PhP 200,000 to the individual awardees and PhP 250,000 to the awarded units.

During his speech, President Duterte stressed his firm stand against illegal drugs as it would ruin the next generation and result to a dysfunctional family.

"Do not compromise the next generation. It is a very serious problem of the country. Do not be afraid to do your duty. 'Wag kayong matakot… As Commander-in-Chief, I am not asking you of anything. I am asking, just asking you to be conscious na may next generation," he said to them.

The President added that he really spent time to visit killed-in-action (KIA) soldiers and policemen not only because he just wanted to condole and sympathize, but to show his solidarity with them.

"You have my full backing and I will see to it that nobody and nobody, not a single soldier or police will go to prison just because he was doing their duty," he said.

After the talk, President Duterte had a photo opportunity with the PNP-PRO X senior officials, other civilian officials, and staff.
