President Rodrigo Roa Duterte spoke before the 514 women officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP) during the 9th National Biennial Summit on Women in Community Policing held in Apo View Hotel in Davao City.

During his speech, the President reassured the police his support to the institution and to them as individuals.

"Just do it in the performance of duty and do it right. Do it legally and I will support you to the end," he said.

To further enhance the PNP's capability to fight drugs and criminality, he looks forward to giving a lecture on a national scale about criminal law. He recalled the years when he had given such lectures for the PNP and how effectively it is executed in Davao City.

President Duterte gave a computation on how the drug trade is gaining billions at the expense of the Filipino people, wherein 92% of the barangays are affected.

"This campaign against drugs and criminality should not lose its momentum," he stressed.

As a reminder to the police, he said, "Do your work, and I will support you 100%". He also announced that crime rate was reduced to almost 50% in his first few months in office.

During the event, the Commander-in-Chief gave PhP 1 million seed money to the police women allocated for the women's social fund in the PNP, and PhP 2,000 worth of per diem for each participant. He also gave away two Glock-30 handguns and a .45 ACP handgun as raffle prizes to the participants. These guns were given to him from a manufacturer as a token of their appreciation on his anti-drug campaign.

President Duterte ended his talk with a promise of a salary increase to all police officers by year 2017.
