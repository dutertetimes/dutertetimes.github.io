PNP Chief, Director General Ronald M Dela Rosa left the country the morning of 24 August on official mission to attend the annual conference of the ASEAN Chiefs of Police (ASEANAPOL) in Putrajaya, Malaysia.

PNP Deputy Chief for Administration, Police Deputy Director General Francisco A Uyami Jr, has been designated PNP Officer-in-Charge. 

Dela Rosa led the 15-man PNP delegation who will join the discussions and committee meetings of the 4-day 36th ASEANAPOL conference hosted by the Royal Malaysian Police.

"The PNP is honored to take an active part in the efforts of the international law enforcement community in maintaining an atmosphere of peace and stability in the Southeast Asian region", Dela Rosa said before embarking on the 4-day official mission.

The Chief PNP will present in the plenary session the PNP's country paper on current transnational crime concerns, including efforts aimed at strengthening international cooperation with other police forces in the ASEAN against transnational syndicates.

High in the agenda of the 36th ASEANAPOL conference are discussions on international cooperation and law enforcement best practices on curbing drug trafficking, commercial crimes, bank fraud, cybercrime, and trafficking in persons.

The 36th ASEANAPOL Conference also seeks greater commitment of the ASEAN national police forces to closely monitor and exchange information on newly-emerging militant and radical groups, and take action on other pressing regional security concerns on international fugitives, cross-border law enforcement, illegal wildlife trade, counterfeit currency syndicates, illegal firearms, smuggling and piracy in the high seas.

The 10-member ASEANAPOL is composed of the Royal Brunei Police Force, Cambodian National Police, Indonesian National Police, Lao People's Democratic Republic General Department of Police, Myanmar Police Force, Philippine National Police, Singapore Police Force, Royal Thai Police, Socialist Republic of Vietnam Police, and this year's host agency, the Royal Malaysia Police.

Also expected to attend are dialogue partners from Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia, Turkey and the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) with representatives fromTimor Leste, the United Kingdom, Europol and International Committee of the Red Cross sitting as observers.
