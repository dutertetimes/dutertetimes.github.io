The Supreme Court (SC) ordered other 240 Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) to hear, try and decide newly filed cases under Republic Act 9165 or The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. According to the SC order this would "help decongest the dockets of specially-designated drugs courts and expedite the resolution of drug cases." The order took effect on 19 July 2016.

Republic Act 9165, Section 90, also known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, as amended, the Supreme Court designated 65 "special courts" among the existing RTCs to exclusively try and hear cases involving violations of the act.
There are also 529 RTCs in single and multiple-sala stations which also hear and decide drug cases.
There are also 121 RTCs specially-designated as Family Courts having exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide drug cases against minors pursuant to Republic Act No. 8369.
In total, there are 715 RTCs that have been authorized to hear and decide drug cases.
