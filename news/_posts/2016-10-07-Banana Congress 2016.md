President Rodrigo Roa Duterte attends the Banana Congress 2016 "New Frontiers for Inclusive Industry Growth" together with Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol at SMX Convention Centre, SM Lanang Premier, Davao City
on 7 October 2016.

The event is led by the Philexport-XI in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Department of Trade and Industry and Mindanao Development Authority. It is also supported by the Mindanao Trade Expo Foundation Inc., Mindanao Banana Farmers and Exporters Association Inc., Pilipino Banana Growers and Exporters Association (PBGEA) and Federation of Cooperatives in Mindanao.

The three-day convention will address crucial problems and challenges of the banana industry.
Among the issues to be addressed is about the need to mitigate the problem on Panama disease.

##### Panama Disease

Fusarium wilt of banana, popularly known as Panama disease is a fungal disease caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense_.
The fungus enters the plant through the roots and colonizes the _xylem_ vessels, blocking the flow of water and nutrients.
Progression results in the collapse of leaves at the petiole, the splitting of the pseudostem base and eventually plant death.

Once established in a field, the fungus persists in soil for an indefinite period of time and cannot be managed using chemical pesticides.
The solution best adapted to the continued production of bananas in infested soils is replacing susceptible cultivars by resistant ones.
Fusarium wilt is the first disease of bananas to have spread globally.
