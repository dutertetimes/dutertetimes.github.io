President Rodrigo Roa Duterte administered the oath taking of 25 officials heading the National Executive Committee of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP), as well as sworn into office several newly appointed government officials, in a simple ceremony in Malacañang.

Speaking before the new leaders, President Duterte reiterated his campaign against issues that threaten the development of the country, two of which pertain to the war on drugs and corruption. According to the President, these have been part of his platform since the election campaign, saying that the new officials should place these in their hearts. He also admitted that it would take long to combat these, which is why he is asking for their help.

"Six years is a very limited time. If I could just get a fraction of the corruption sa ating gobyerno, mukhang okay na. I cannot erase all, I cannot stop it, but I can minimize it," President Duterte said.

He added, "Kapag hinayaan ko, it will destroy the next generation by the sheer contamination and wide spread... That is for my country. I am not doing it for somebody else."
