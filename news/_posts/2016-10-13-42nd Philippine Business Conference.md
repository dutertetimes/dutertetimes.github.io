PBC and Expo is a two-day event that gathered different stakeholders to discuss updates on lessening the business cost, infrastructures that would harness competitiveness, and open trade opportunities.  The event also became an avenue to talk on the cooperation of the ASEAN, East Asian and Asia-Pacific economies, the legislative agenda promoting inclusive growth, the interventions backing the local economies, generating supply of workforce equipped with skills demanded by the industries, among others.

"This has to take on an even active role in shaping our country's future as we zoom ahead to an increasingly competitive, integrated global economic landscape. ‘Giant Steps 2016 and Beyond' encompasses the vision of everyone in this room — that of the inclusive economy where people enjoy quality life of the world-class Philippine business sector," PCCI President George Barcelon said.

President Rodrigo Roa Duterte attended the event together with the Department of Finance (DOF) Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Ramon Lopez joined the President.
