According to Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) 2013 press release, the Philppines economically and financially loses an estimated P2.4 billion a day due to traffic congestion. In 2014, JICA study concluded that without intervention, traffic costs will be likely to increase to P6 billion a day.

The Transporation Crisis Act of 2016 aims to enable the administration to be more effective in solving the transportation crisis in Metro Manila and other key cities in the country.
The proposed bill will have a 2-year effectivity "unless sooner withdrawn by a resolution of Congress, without prejudice to rights and benefits that may have been vested, and culpabilities and liabilities that may have been incurred."

The bill will empower the administration to utilize alternative modes of procurement, prohibition on lower courts from issuing Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) on critical transportation related projects and the power to reorganize the Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority.

The default mode of procurement is competitive bidding which is a lengthy and complicated process to be an effective means to help solve the transportation problem.
The proposed bill includes other modes of procurement like procurement from a previous winning bidder, procurement off the shelf and negotiated procurement.

Prohibition of Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) on transportation related projects that could inhibit right-of-way acquisition, bids and awards for transportation projects, the implementation or operation of any transportation project identified by the President, the termination of transportation projects and "the undertaking or authorization of any other lawful activity necessary for any transportation project identified by the President."

The bill will also allow the President to reorganize agencies; abolish or create offices; split or merge positions; transfer functions, equipments, properties, records and personnel; institute drastic cost-cutting measures; and other related actions to solving the transportation crisis.
