SPEECH OF PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE</br>
DURING THE LAUNCHING OF THE</br>
PILIPINONG MAY PUSO FOUNDATION, INC.</br>
Garden Pavilion, Waterfront Hotel, Davao City</br>
November 11, 2016</br>

Ms. Rowena Velasco; and of course, the man who honored the memory of my mother, Mr. Ramon Ang; members of congress; honored guests; ladies and gentlemen.

Ah, I was not expecting a crowd. Akala ko, 'yung tayo-tayo lang and that is why, I came here with a T-shirt. But anyway, I was, or I am very, very late because I had to go to a place where we had a hard time negotiating pababa. It was raining very hard in the mountains and you could just not, ah, make it on time. If you want to make it faster, then baka hindi na aabot dito sa gabing ito.

So, my apologies to you all for indulging me, waiting for me. Ako po'y anak lang ng mahirap. My mother was just a teacher and I remember when we migrated here in Davao City, kami hong mga anak, iniwan muna sa lolo at lola namin sa Bohol where my grandmother, kasi nag-migrate silang dalawa dito, both teachers at that time.

My father was a lawyer, there was not much really to go around those days. Natikman ko po ang kahirap sa buhay. We came here about mga 4, 5, 6, 7 until— you know what, at the back of the Ateneo University, diyan sa Roxas or Jacinto, if you're on the other side street, ang tatay ko po'y gumawa ng isang bahay, lumber. Hindi naman talaga 'yung tipong mahirap na mahirap because at that time, at the back of the Ateneo, kayong mga old timers, ang tawag diyan, kumpayan, 'yung cogon sa tubig na pinapakain sa kabayo.

And I thought that since that was early time, my father thought that there was enough land, although he wanted to choose the—yung sa likod nga ng Ateneo ngayon, yung Jacinto, dahil malapit sa main street. Claveria noon yan.

And you know what, after about mga three years, he found out or he told me, he found out that lahat ng—ang Davao, noon at that early was already titled in the so many names na ang karamihan ho ay mga Tagalog.

You know, hindi nila kasalanan, ang Pilipinas noon when the Americans left, of course they were the first to utilize, to exploit the country, Mindanao. Kasi alam nila walang typhoon and you can just throw anything there at that time, sa mga bundok and it will grow. Eh, wala hong storms, walang lahat, so pinili nila dito.

And you would realize that Davao at that time was just divided into few names. As a matter of fact, all American Filipinos already, ah, 'yung mga cadastral pati 'yung 24 if you are a corporation— hectares, seven if homestead.

And ganun ho ang nangyari and because the Americans wanted to develop the island and ah, kaso kasi at that time or until now, maybe, na pagka Amerikano ka, Kristiyanos ka. And so during the times of the Spaniards for the 400 years that they stayed here and the Americans for 50 years, they lived on the fat of the land, I would say, sila 'yung unang nakinabang. But they could hardly get workers from the Moro population because nobody wanted to work for them. And so there came about the sloganeering, "Go to Mindanao because it is the Land of Promise."

At this stage, ah, may kasalanan ho akong malaki. Ang problema, nakalimutan ko, excited kasi ako sa feelings ko, ma'am, my President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, welcome at magandang gabi po sa inyong lahat.(applause)

I told you before, when you were still President, it was election time, I said, Ma'am, I am a lawyer friend. Nothing—no big deal. Except that along the way, talagang, lalo na 'yung nagkagulo-gulo na, I just kept my fate to myself also, that someday, that .... I was never really close to—though, I supported President Aquino, I was never into the—in the company of the elite. For the six years na siya ang nasa Malacanan, hindi ho ako napasok dun ni minsan.

Panahon ni Ma'am Gloria, almost every week ako doon nagre-report because I was appointed as a consultant for law and order.

Well, go back to our odyssey here, 'yun na nga ho, eh, anak lang ako ng—I  grew up, 'yung mga ibang kapatid ko, the last three, wala na 'yun because my father became the governor. It was only One Davao then. There was no Davao Oriental, Davao Norte, Sur, Davao Occidental. Davao City was already the capital of One Davao.

Nung namatay ang tatay ko, pinaghati-hati na nila 'yun but that moment of—yung medyo maganda ang buhay namin, because you know, the governor receives a salary more than the rest of everybody in government.

Dun lang kami nakatikim ng anong—but when I was even studying at sa, Manila. I never had the company of 'yung mayayaman. Wala talaga akong—yung tipong ano lang ako, ah, middle class na, ibig kong sabihin, ganun lang kami pero you would notice that my father was a soldier.

Actually my father was the first mayor, military mayor of Danao City. Right after the libe—sa liberation ng Philippines. Nakita mo naka-uniporme siya. He was really a soldier. He was a JAGO member and when the Americans started to organize the civil governments all throughout the Philippines, my father was appointed as the first military, civil ano pa noon, mayor of Danao City.

Eventually, paglipat namin dito, he became governor for two terms. 'Yan ang buhay ho namin dito. But what really was, what was in the family, simple po. My father, so you can just rightly assume that when he was called a soldier, he was a soldier. So, the love of country.

Ang nanay ko naman, ito 'yung sa civic, having come from a mixed blood. So she—makita mo in the portrayal there, she's with the Moro. She's with the Lumads. Ganun ang buhay ng nanay ko, right after she retired as a Supervisor sa Department of Education. She was a teacher.

So, yan ang istorya namin. She spent most of her time helping, not necessarily the poor, but helping, just to be there to help.

'Yan ang nakuha ko sa nanay ko pati 'yung bunganga. My father was— ayyy, talagang tahimik na tao. Pag hindi mo kinausap, hindi ka kausapin nun. And why he became a mayor, eh hindi naman 'yun kasi he was just picked up from the ranks at that time. But 'yung naging governor siya, he was a very quiet man. And some—many of the complaints, they could hardly get into his garden sa buhay niya.

He would not ask you, ano ang problema mo, ikaw ang magtanong, mayor, governor, ako ang napunta sa nanay ko.

So nung mayor ako, I was really very strict, that's why there was no smoking, no firecrackers, wala lahat. Even 'yung karaoke. Until now, I don't know if Inday still enforces the regulation. Walang karaoke after 9 because I told them that your neighbors are already sleeping and the children have to wake up early. So, if you keep on that patugtug at pati 'yung mga boses, boses palaka, puro lasing, you are disturbing the public peace.

Istrikto po ako dito, because 'yun ang nakuha ko sa tatay ko rin. The law is the law as the law. Kaya ito ngayong kay President Marcos, simply, what is the law? The law is the law, it is, it has no emotions at all. It says that if you are a President and does not say you have a record of a dictatorship or what not or gain a gentle despot, walang sinabi niyan. The law says that if you are a soldier, you are qualified to be there. And if you are the President, you are supposed to be buried there if you want to.

Kaya ako nauna na ako to obviate possible wranglings if I die tomorrow, I want my— whatever remains of my remains, burn it. And that's what happened, because my mother, she was very, a high profile civic leader, she was president for so many times, 'yang mga girls scout lahat na yan, mental health.Hinawakan niya 'yan for so many years.

Ako ang hindi niya na ano sa mental health. 'Yun ang ano niya, but ang sabi talaga niya, "if I die, 24 hours," but of course, she was a, maybe thepractices of a Moro, Maranao mother. Kaya namatay siya 3 o'clock in the morning, at 1 o'clock noon, sabi niya, "beinte-kuwatro oras," sabi ko, "huwag na."Sabi niya, "within 24 hours."

So, noong namatay, walang nakaalam sa Davao na patay na pala ang nanay ko. Sabi nila, "saan binuburol ang nanay mo?" Sabi ko, "walang burol." Nasunog na and the ashes spread all throughout in the place that was used to farm the lands in the mountains.

Ako, ganun din. Let us make the record straight. Burn me immediately and place it, my ashes beside my mother's urn. So, wala kayong problema kung ako mamatay, kung malibing ako diyan o hindi. Ibigay mo na lang sa maraming—

Well, anyway, dito tayo sa—what brought really, si Weng, pati yung ibang mga makausap ko, si Mr. Ramon Ang, whom I deeply respect.

Hindi ho sabihin nagkikita kami noon na nag-uusap kami ng pulitika or pera but because of a mutual friend. Nakakain kami doon. I get invited to eat the 'yung masarap na baka. Anong pangalan 'nung yawa na 'yun? 'Yung ano, huwag yung—so, masarap eh, nagkikita kami doon.

And ang istorya ko naman ganito. You know, I know that there was a problem. I know that Davao City had a serious problem with drugs. But I could not really make the correct projection of how many, how much, when inside Davao City.

The thing that I knew, talagang medyo malala at ang krimen, mataas. So, sinabi ko, if I win, kindly get out of Davao City. Kayong mga criminal, mga durugista, mga kidnapper, holdapper, 'yung mga rapist, lalo na ang hilig ninyo mag-rape tapos pumatay ng tao. Hindi ko kayo paaabutin ng istasyon sa pulis, if you kill your victim.

And so it was, it came to pass na ganun eh.So, we had a lesser crime rate than the rest of the country and I always win the best police, na-monopolize namin for so many years but only for one reason. The police, nagta-trabaho are or were working at that time. Kasi hindi ako pumapayag sa pulis, sabi ko, pag nandyan kayo at nandyan ang droga, sigurado 'yan, kasali ka. Huwag mo akong bulahin kasi galing ako diyan sa baba.

Talagang pinipiga ko, every city police director na magpunta dito, makinig ho kayo kasi this is a matter of survival for the nation. I don't know what the—tomorrow would bring us to.But ganito eh, nung nag-Presidente ako, I promised you only three things, but most of the time, I would interject some statements about economic recovery, something like that. But I know na pag ang isang lugar, magulo; maraming krimen, di talaga aaakyat yan.

When I became mayor at the crossroads of the revolution of EDSA at itong mga NPA; and ang relasyon ko sa NPA was really very good because of my mother. She used to go to the mountains, kilala niya lahat. And sometimes, bumababa, lalo na 'yung mga madre na kung saan-saan nanggaling, wala namang dormitoryo, mga NPA rin pala, they would go to the house for the night.

So 'yung pamilya namin saka 'yung dimension ko, medyo left leaning ako, in matters of the social dimensions of life. How you deal with the rich and the poor. How you would strive to at least not really equalize, make the other side more comfortable than the other, kasi nandiyan na sa kanila ang lahat.

Dun ako, kaya ako, I was crossing the ideological borders. Something which was used against me during the first election in 1988; na ako kuno, komunista.

I am not communist. Maybe I am a socialist. My father was a military man, he became a military mayor, became a governor. I was once upon a time, a Prosecutor. I was doing trial work almost everyday to earn my keep for eight, eight years. Paano ako maging—

So 'yung ganun, madali kong kinausap ang Left. Sabi ko, ako na ang mayor, I do not want a quarrel with you pero kung gusto ninyo, wala man akong magawa. You know my work, and you should know yours. So umalis ko sa— 'yung mga sparrow at NPA. Ang naiwan dito sa Davao, ang mga kriminal because at that time sa martial law; every Tom, Dick and Harry, Juan dela Cruz, Pedro, Sulpicio; pag anti- communist ka, the firearms were freely given.

Maski sino dito, alsa masa, lahat na, anti-communist. And government itself was manufacturing "paltik" inside the barracks, ang tawag natin Philippine National Police.

They had a lathe machine and they were giving— tama nga 'nung nagkaroon na ng armas, parang nag—, it was already a parity, tabla na. So, barilin mo ako, barilin kita. It helped but the great consequence of that was, or after martial law, walang trabaho; puro may armas and hold-up dito, hold-up doon; kidnap dito, kidnap doon. 

Eh, ako knowing their contribution, at least during the violent days, medyo softie ako konti. Some of them were my friends.

Pero 'yung— it went out of control, everybody who had a gun think that he was God, so nagkagulo. Kaya sabi ko, either huminto kayo. Noon, they would just enter any house here in Davao City noon and just hostage the family and because you cannot withdraw more than P50,000 or even 1 million, let alone kung million na. For the entire nandoon sila sa bahay, they were raping the wife, the children and the helpers and all that. So naging ano ako, praning, so I gave them the warning.

'Nung medyo ayaw, patayan kami. But pinatay ko talaga lahat. And I know—When I say that do not destroy my country because I will kill you, do not destroy or deprive us of our generation of children next to us because I will really kill you. There is really nothing wrong with it. Eh maski sabihin ko, panain kita, pag hindi ka umalis dito.

Eh, I have every right as a mayor, and as a President to utter those words, even if they are ugly to hear and maybe a barbarian relic. 'Yun ang sinabi ko sa Maynila, huwag ninyong gagawin yan kasi papatayin ko kayo.

Ang human rights picked that particular words and phrase and he was heard. That was the basis of the EU. 'Yung abugado na lang ang pulpul.

'Yung mga putang-ina kayo, huwag ninyo akong isali sa kabuka ninyo. Every, every government leader, every policeman, even a civilian can say: you criminals, if you do wrong, I will kill you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Eh, kung sabihin mo, patayin mo si ano, yung ganun; yung babae diyan, hanapin ninyo yung sa inyo, yung video na yan at putulan mo ng leeg, that is a different story.

But even then, so that gave rise to, itong ano. Ma-explain ko na lang sa inyo ang paghihinanakit ko. So, I kept on threatening it because nag-umpisa na eh. But remember that there were or there are still— 

May sasabihin ako sa inyong mawalaan kayo ng gana. So, there were about 6, 7 generals I fired immediately because they were into drugs. And they— perhaps, you might want to think that who did the cleaning? Who was doing the cleansing, the purging? Kami?

We never started it, very much late. The early killings, wala kaming pakialam. 'Yung talian, tapos balutin ng plastic, tape. Bakit maggawa kami ng mummy? We are not exporting mummies in this country.


If you want to kill him just shoot him in the head. Bakit pa ba you waste your time? And that would indicate something more serious in the game. Noong nag-umpisa na, tapos sabi ko, I will protect you, just do your job. Arrest them. Look out. Puntahan ninyo sila. Arrest them and if they would resist violently and you think, you'll die, kill them. That's all I said. And that is still the order of the day. Gawain ninyo yan. Yan ang utos ko. Ako ang bahala. I will protect you.

At sinabi ko noong dumating ako galing ako sa labas kagabi (unclear) sabi na— yung pulis na CIDG, sabi ko, if they acted strictly in obedience to my order, in accordance with the rules of law, you don't have anything to worry. I will answer for you. And if need be I will go to prison for them. And if I rot in prison, so be it. Walang problema sa akin. I'm 72 years old. If you make some actuarial, pinakamalakas ko diyan is 5, 6 years. When I get to read all the books that nakapatong nayan lahat, na ni minsan, hindi ko man nabasa. No time. 

Ngayon, why? Well, according to Santiago, the PDEA head during my— time mo yata, ma'am? Sa PDEA? He gave us a figure of three million Filipinos already afflicted by drugs. Yung pag-umpisa ko, pati ako, I was appalled by this— what happened later on. Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos lining up in front of the police stations and the barangay, nagsu-surrender at magpapagamot.

I reckon that by the end of the year, hindi ako nag-add ng aking figures muna, hayaan mo muna, let alone yung kay Santiago, I would have reached the four million mark. Plus one million, mag-four million ako. Anak ng—and this four millions are spread all throughout the country. Mga 6,000 policemen are into drugs. There are about 4,000 municipal mayors into drugs. A few city mayors and about one or two congressmen and another four governors. Mindanao lahat yan. How do we solve the problem?

So, when the validation sa aking numbers, ganito kakapal. That's why, I called for a—which is really being done. I invited— we'll have a tete a tete of sorts sa Malacanang. 

Sabihin ko talaga sa kanya, sabihin ko talaga sa inyo, 'Congressman Bob, you solve the problem. I could not solve the problem.' Every page, pag ganunin mo, puro pangalan yan.Ganun kakapal. Barangay captains, municipal mayors, pulis; sabi ko, ginusto ko mang patayin ito, mauubusan ako ng panahon. Hindi ko kaya ito. Hindi ko talaga kaya. Anong gagawin natin niyan?

Ang ibig kong sabihin, narco-politics is already here and whether she pretends to be what she is not, De Lima opened the portals of narco-politics that started in the National penitentiary. Doon naglaro and until now, hindi na masyado ngayon, kasi maski sa presohan, naglalaro ang mga putang-ina nila. Yan ang problema natin. 

As a matter of fact, ang direction, sila lang may makaalam eh. And kung mag-shabu ka dito na hindi ka kaparte ngayon dito. Talagang yayariin ka. Papasabugin ka diyan tapos gobyerno; may gobyerno ba manang magga-granada? Pag kasi ngayon, ano na sila and because yung— the ruling elite ng drugs, nandiyan sa loob ng preso, Chinese pati yung cohorts nila.

Si Kerwin? Kerwin has a list. I hope he comes back alive. Patay na yung tatay niya. Tatay niya, sabi nila na sinalvage, or that's a loose term eh. Salvaging, The word "salvaging" is really salvage of a wreckage of a ship that has sunk and there's this salvage law that governs it. I don't know how it came about but it was used in a popular— na salvage eh yung pinapatay. 

May listahan siya. Same yung mga listahan na nakuha na natin na sa iba. May mga pulis na nandoon. Same. Halos pareho. Odicta, lahat yung mga bigtime dito sa— so, ang akin is, I am the President. Of course, I have the powers. But it's a very limited, but powerful limited functions. I cannot for the life of me imagine where I have to execute five, ten Filipinos everyday. Before a firing squad because for one person alone, to build a case, to gather the proof, I would need two or three policemen, about isang linggong surveillance bago ko makuha yung gusto kong ebidensiya.

Kaya kita mo naman kung ganoon ang gagawin ko, how do I cope up? And besides, I cannot prove it beyond reasonable doubt. Cellphone lang eh, kaya pinag-aawayan yang cellphone, kasi nandiyan lahat. But there are other ways that we can maybe know what you are really doing, what you are really up to but at this time, and I'm not privileged to— alam ni Presidente Arroyo yan. But we can only do so much.

Now, balik tayo doon sa confirmed figures ni— at 200 per (sniff), kung family man yan, that's about 6,000 a month sa three million; it would sum up to like 18 billion. Yearly, that's about two hundred sixteen billion a year industry. Yung pera niyan, yung iba, nagtatrabaho instead of the money going to the table for the food of the family, medisina, edukasyon; pag ang head of the family tinamaan, tabla na; they go hungry.  

So there is already a social dysfunction. Kasi itong pagka karamihan diyan, the middle class, maghiwalay yan. Alam ninyo. Alam ko marami kayo. Maghiwalay, ang mga bata, wala na. So kasi ang tatay nire-rape niya minsan ang anak niya.
Nangyayari dito sa Davao yan, diyan sa Insular Village. Ito, dito mga hiwalay. Tapos rehab ng rehab. Ang rehab is about doon sa— ongoing rate sa Capitol City, I think, it's about 300,000 thousand per person. Kinom-pute namin sa government, it would amount to one trillion. Pina re-compute ko sa gobyerno, kay Sonny Dominguez with all the minus-minus, you would need about 900- plus per person— thousand. Na detox tapos for a few months, then learning the skills kung ano pa ang kaya nila. But there are persons using drugs more than one year ,mga Amerikano na rin nagbigay niyang data niyan eh, that if you end up with a shrunk brain, no more redemption, no rehab would be possible. Kaya kung yan lang naman ang ma-accomplish ko sa pagka-presidente ko.

I don't care if I really— I have no illusions. Sabi nila, they want to impeach me, go ahead. Be my guest. Sabihin nila na patayin nila ako, the better. Eh di makapaghinga tayo ng medyo aga-aga pero di ako aatras dito. And I would insist that the version of the police in the killing of Mayor Espinosa is the correct version insofar as I am concerned.

And I will not, I will not abandon them. If they go to prison, so would I. Yan ang taya ko diyan, because the greater danger, I know na— ninyo alam. I know that this is a world of hypocrisy but there is more than meets the eye. It's the preservation of the Filipino children. Bakit mo pakialaman, 3,000 dead? Eh samantalang ako, 23 years akong mayor dito, ang napatay ko lang daw, 1,000? Paka-cheapskate! Why? Kuripot ako kung ganoon sa buhay ng tao. Eh talagang papatayin kita eh. Because you are destroying my country. Ako yung naabutan eh sa kamalas-malas. Hindi pa doon sa isa. (laughter)

It was because when I became president, I started to squeeze. Yung mga assignment, siguro ikaw, ikaw, gusto ka, ako diyan. Pero sabi ko tang-ina ninyo, huwag ninyo akong lokohin. Do not ever, ever monkey with me, sabi ko. Hindi ninyo akong lokohin. Magka—but I started to squeeze them. Lumabas, kita mo sa TV? Not alone would leave you—give you the scare of your life! Ano ba naman yung 3,000? Di muna siniguro kung pinatay ba talaga, pero hindi naman talaga eh. Lalo yung binabalot, nagagalit ako diyan. Hindi, hindi ka nila— alam nila, ayaw ko ng kabastusan yang parang mummy, gastos pa nga. Tortured maybe but we are not into it. There are many ways of doing it. May tubig o lagay mo lang yang ulo diyan sa balon. Yun ang ano, the Chinese ano yan eh, style yang balot-balot.

So yan ang, that's really my message. My mother was a civic leader and she was also really doing something for her fellowmen. Ako, hindi ko hayaan ito. I would consider it a failure na mawala ako sa presidente, tapos ganito ang sitwasyon. I would be terribly disappointed.

But ako? Impeachment? Wala 'yan, as long as I am impeached or I am killed and the reason is because I was just trying my best to do something for my country, that's it.

I don't need the praises and everything. It is not worth of my... on it. Sabi, ba't pinatay? Eh, gusto talaga niya talaga na, so, for as long as there,the problem is there. As long as there is a pusher in the street or on the streets, as long as there are drug lords who are still doing it and alive, this thing will continue until the end of my term. Kailan 'yan? Ewan ko.

Pero, talagang hihiritan kita, hindi ako pwedeng magpa-ano. I know that it is something, terribly, perception. Depends on kung saan ka eh. Mine is self-defense, in defense of the helpless children na, and they are not in a position to really weigh things and even the, 'yung mga adult. It is a defense of a race, it is in defense of my fellowmen.

Sa ganoong karami, with people now elected into public office, we are now in narco politics. And if you want to see a horror of the stories there, you can read Ion Grillo. I-O-N-G-R-I-L-L-O.

Sa, makuha mo 'yan sa, diyan sa internet, saan ba yun? Online, then cartel, then the drug lords.

Exactly, exactly the first 100 pages. The Philippines is going that way. But as long as I am in that office there, I will never allow it. Magkapatayan na tayo kung patayan.

Ngayon, I will try to connect because there is a rebellion. Ang Maute, grabe ang bakbakan dito, baka akala ninyo. There is a rebellion, there is a rebellion being waged down in Mindanao.

At kung magkalat itong still lawlessness, I might be forced to— ayaw ko, ayaw ko. Warning ko lang sa kanila 'yan, ayaw ko kasi hindi maganda. But if you force my hand into it, I will declare the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, not Martial Law. Wala akong balak sa pulitika. But I will— kasi wala akong remedy eh. I cannot issue an order without a valid—

I have to build a case one by one. Itong sa pulis naman ako, I will declare a suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, pick-apin ko 'yan lahat. Dalhin ko diyan sa Samal. Butasan ko 'yang Samal sa gitna para lumubog, kasali na sila. Mamili sila. Totoo.

If you don't give me a choice then you box me in, in a corner and I find myself helpless because, we have—kaya nandiyan 'yan eh. Those are really provisions intended to protect the Republic of the Philippines.

I can be ordered by the Supreme Court to stop it but there are things which they cannot, and maybe, I will not stop. Eh, bahala sabihin ko na muna tapusin ko 'to, tapos I can go to jail.

File all the charges that you can think of. But this country, in my time, will not deteriorate any further. At yung, kung sakali, magdating na 'yung mga tulong na ano natin. Now, let me talk about America, para maintindihan.

Alam ko, marami 'yung, the middle class, but they are known Filipinos, pro-American talaga 'yan. Wala man akong away sa Amerikano, and you can ask President Arroyo.

I never said anything about America in the past. Pero akin na, nung lumabas na itong extrajudicial killing. They would like to assume na 'yung 3,000 plus, going 4,000, para bang pinatay ng gobyerno. Then threatening me that I will go to the International Court of Justice. For what? For saying that I will kill you if you destroy my country?

Anong ma-ano mo sa akin? For saying that you destroy the next generation, I will kill you. So what's wrong with that?

Itong mga abugado na 'yan, ginamit pa. He was heard saying, I will kill you all, and so, you want me to go to prison for saying I will kill you because you're destroying the Republic of the Philippines? Mga bugok.

Siguro mga Harvard or Cambridge 'yan, eh, kung ganun pala. Sabi ko, puta, wala kayo dito. Dito tayo mag-trial. Tingnan natin kung saan kayo pulutin. Stupid. Kaya lahat na ng pangalan.

Ang America ganito, ito lang ang simple and I will end my talk. Every time that they would criticize me in writing or verbal, mga TV, they would always have that phrase, "we will suspend or we will cut the aid and assistance to your country." Every time, every time. Be it the human rights, mga ulol, tapos itong EU, mga torpe talaga. State Department, isa pa kayo diyan, tapos then Obama. 'Nong sinabi ni Obama, nag-react na, sabi ko, "pati ikaw, torpe ka." You know, do not do that.

When I was mayor, I was heavily criticized for the situation sa Davao, okay lang. But when I became President, do not reprimand me in public, pahiya ang Pilipino.

Hindi nila alam, they should have realized, ka-bright ng mga putang-inang 'yan. Hindi na naisip itong mga ulol, letse kayo. That I was carrying on my shoulder the sovereignty.

I was, I'm now representing a country, tapos you reprimand me publicly. At saka sabihin mo na, "we will not give the aid," bara pagang tinalian mo ako sa isang poste dito, tapos 'yung pan, itatapon mo doon sa malayo, at until his tongue drops to the ground, para bang gutom na, may bisaya kami dyan.

Wag ninyo kaming—para bang patay-gutom kami. We will survive. Pag nag—if I get the blame sa Filipino people, sabihin mo, I will accept it but someday, you will understand. There is such a thing as dignity, dignity of a race, not me.

However, you look at me, maliit, insignificant, fine. I don't need it even. Pero 'wag yang ganon-ganon because every time you do that and Irepresent the Republic of the Philippines, ginagawa mo kaming patay-gutom, mga putang-ina ninyo. Letse kayo, dun ako nagalit.

Kaya ako pagka pagalitin mo ako, eh, what will be my defense? I was trying to explain to the people eh 'yang 3,000 na 'yan, hindi namin trabaho, but nobody was listening. I tried to explain the gravity of the offense, ayaw nilang makinig, eh, kate-text sila doon EJ, extra judicial.

Kaya sabi ko, ayaw ninyo makinig, sabi ko, "hoy, mga putang-ina ninyong—mga letse kayo, mga torpe kayo, oh then, they took notice.Sino 'yung nagmumura ng presidente natin? Di sino pa, di ako. Letse kayo lahat. Sige diyan kayo, gusto niyo, diyan kayo, diyan. O, di napansin na nila ako ngayon.

So, magtanong ka, sinong mayor ng Buenos Aires ngayon? Hindi mo alam. Sinong mga, mayor ng Kilong City sa Taiwan? 'Di mo alam. Tanungin mo, sinong mayor sa, 'yung kuwan, governor sa, mayor, Presidente sa Pilipinas? Duterte. Eh bakit? Kami lang tatlo: ako, si Obama, si Jinping, pati siya diyan, kami lang nag-aagawan diyan sa Al Jazeera. O di putang-ina ninyo, kilalanin niyo ako, mga yawa kayo.(laughter)

Maraming salamat po.
