Labor and Employment Secretary Silvestre H. Bello III on 27 August said that the Department will deploy more Labor Attachés and welfare officers in Saudi Arabia where there are huge number of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).

"I think we need more labor attachés and welfare officers in Saudi Arabia because of the number of OFWs there. Maraming migrant workers doon ang may problema," said Bello.

He added that DOLE will deploy two labor attachés per Philippine Overseas Labor Office (POLO) in the Middle East instead of only one.

"I am placing two for Riyadh and two for Jeddah," said Bello, adding that if possible, he would also deploy two Labor Attachés in Al-Khobar.
Bello said that the increased number of labor attachés will enable the government to assist more distressed OFWs in the said Middle East countries.

The secretary previously ordered two Labor Attachés in Saudi Arabia, Rustico dela Fuente and Jainal Rasul Jr., to return to the Philippines over their supposed failure to perform their duties for the more than 11,000 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who were stranded in Riyadh and Jeddah.
