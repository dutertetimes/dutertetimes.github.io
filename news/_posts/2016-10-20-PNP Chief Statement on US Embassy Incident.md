Napanood ko ang video at nakakalungkot at nakakagalit.
I saw the people got hurt.
Ayaw na ayaw ko na may nasasaktan na Pilipino.
But I cannot let emotions get the best of me.

As the Chief of the National Police, I have a duty and moral obligation to look into this squarely and deal with it swiftly and decisively.

The Philippine National Police recognizes and upholds the citizen's right to peaceful assembly.
Police forces are under strict instrucion as a matter of policy to exercise maximum tolerance in such public assemblies with public safety and protection of human life and utmost concern and topmost priority.

With what transpired at Roxas Boulevard in Ermita, Manila yesterday, an investigation and full review is under way and necessary sanctions will be levied on any personnel guilty of putting lives at risk.
Upon my instructions, RD NCRPO Police Chief Superintendent Oscar Albayalde has placed all officers involved in that particular police operation under administrative relief to ensure utmost impartiality of the investigation.

The president has been briefed about the incident and he stressed on the obligations of our police to serve and protect the people.
But as he said, we cannot point fingers right away without clear investigation.

Our other priority now is to look into the victims and check on their recovery and safety after such an unfortunate incident.
