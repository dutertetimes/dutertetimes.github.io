Lieutenant General Miranda; Lieutenant General Año; Lieutenant General Guerrero; Major General Valencia; the officers, enlisted personnel of the 10thInfantry Division; my co-workers in government.

Can somebody could order the tikas pahinga?

Alam mo o alam ninyo, I have been around for almost 23 years in this area, not really as a superior but kasama ninyo sa trabaho and for all the years that I have been mayor or I was mayor for 23 years, kasama ninyo ako in all of the—pag-usapan ang kapayapaan dito sa Region 11.

And I am very glad that my career expands for so many years. As a matter of fact, the first time that I visited this camp was during the time of—si General Danny Olayand he was a very good soldier and he was a very fine gentleman.Siya 'yung unang nagyaya sa akin dito, I used to ride the motor going to Agusan and back, kasi maganda 'yung highway dito noon. I don't know if it's still good but dumadaan kami dito sa kanya at kumakain kami ng lunch before proceeding towards Butuan.

I miss those days and the friendship of those who passed this—the portals of this camp, used to be known as the 602 Brigade? Yes. And lahat ng dumaan dito, alam mo sa totoo lang naging halos chief-of-staff lahat. Almost all of them. Angie, sila—si Roy Cimatu. Roy is my Special Envoy to the Middle East. I took him in again and just in preparation for the—sabi ko: "Roy, hayaan mo muna yung mga gulo diyan ngayon sa mga trabahante na wala nang trabaho because that is not really your problem. You can be best utilize by the government kung may gulo na and may naiipit na mga Pilipino doon." But he is there, he is working with me and several others na dumaan dito.

Halos 'yung gobyerno ko, ex-military men and PNP. Si Jorge Corpuz, who is this? Balutan sa Marines, iniligay ko sa Philippine Charity Sweepstakes, which is one of the most corrupt.

Alam mo ang ginawa ng mga gago? Yung legal na lotto, hinalo nila sa jueteng. Sabi nila sa gobyerno, kami na ang magpapatakbo. And yet everyday, 'yung 20 per cent lang ang hinuhulog nila. Yung iba, sa kanila na. So we have lost billions of pesos throughout the years.


Kaya ito, sabi ko, kailangan ko ng mga berdugo dito. Berdugo in the sense that the military men would insist only for what is right, yung tama lang.

And I am happy to be associated with the finest officers in town. Halos yan kaharap ko, dumaan sa Task Force Davao and I would not answer for the things that—yung kay Inday, sa anak ko. But nung kami, we are the best of relations.

Now itong putok-putok, I really prophesied it in advance, na ito, pag naipit ito kasi bakbakan ngayon diyan banda sa Jolo, magreresbak talaga ito for the lives lost. In this fight sa Islamic insurrection, medyo talaga ang Mindanao, bugbog.

That is why I was hesitant really at first to start a new offensive because I wanted another mga 10 battalions of—sa SAF for the urban terrorism. Eh kayo naman, maski saan kayo itapon sa buong mundo eh, kaya.

But times could not wait, yun nabugbog, ganun talaga. And Davao is not really a stranger to this mga catastrophic bombing. Church, cathedrals was bombed twice, airport, pantalan. Along the way, several hundreds of people died and I was really expecting, that is why when the news came in and urgent call that there was an explosion. Hindi na masyado ako—sabi ko, sinabi ko na 'yan, nandiyan 'yan.

But, you know, tayong mga taga-gobyerno and even the civilian sector must understand the plight of the nation.

Ako, I've been talking to the MI. Sabi nga noon ni Murad eh, that he will go to war without the Moro, Bangsa Law—Bangsamoro Law. Mabuti't na lang, lahat kami, hindi lang ako, nakiusap sa kanya that: Anong makuha natin? What will happen to this island of Mindanao?

Ang istorya kasi niyan dito sa Mindanao, kaya mahirap talaga kunin is, 'nong 1521, si Magellan nag-landing sa Leyte, and sabi niya, he discovered the Philippines. Napaka-gago 'yung—tarantado 'yung buang na 'yun. Discover na we were doing all right. Di-discover? Nandito na tayo eh. Why should he discover us? We're doing fine.

But in a way, he went in. Brought his cannons, gunpowder, the muskets, 'yung the rifle of the times, you can shoot somebody na medyo may distansya on a safe side. And that is why, they were able to conquer island for island until Luzon. Hindi naman contiguous itong Luzon pati Visayas but Mindanao is a very solid island.

But at that time, when he went down his ship, itong Mindanao, Islam na ito, almost 100 percent, because historically, if you look at the books and you go into the archives of Malaysia and Indonesia, these things are narrated and Mindanao was already a port of call.


Ibig sabihin, meron na nitong taga-Sabah doing business here. It was a thriving activity until the Spaniards took notice of it and added it to the territories that they conquered.

But they were not able to go inside doon sa pinaka-bituka ng Mindanao. Diyan lang 'yan sila sa coastal and they were able to build the Fort Pilar. But it was to stop the inroads of the Muslim missionaries.

Pati Moro people here were already really Islam. And so they tried to conquer it bloody and in the war between Spaniards and America, the Spaniards lost, so receded, is part of the surrender, ibinigay ang Pilipinas, the Marianas island, including Guam. Mga territory at that time, parehong mga istubador na ito. So if you go to Guam, if you have been there, you'd notice na mga apelyido nila pati pangalan, just like ours, Spanish name. 'Yan ang ano.

And when the Americans took over, they really wanted to get Mindanao. Nalaman nila Mindanao was below the typhoon belt and they could plant here more productively than the rest of the country because of the incessant climate changes. Bagyo nang bagyo. That is how it is. And, just to a footnote of history but is very important for you to consider it.

In the campaign against the Moro people, they really killed something like almost about—doon sa Jolo and in one massacre 6,000 men, women, and child.

Dito sa Lanao, it's a repeat history also, patayan. But one particular incident stands out and that is the Samar massacre.

'Yung Balangiga na bell, kinuha nila. That is a very sentimental thing for us because there, 10 years above, talagang pinatay nila, known us the massacre of Samar. Yun 'yun.

But tayo, because we are assimilated dito sa western side and America was able to pacify us. Ang mga Muslim ang mahirap. I'm talking about this is—was  ganito.

We're talking to the left and I thank God that things are going on smoothly. Baka maka-tsamba tayo dito, baka lang. And I hope that Dureza and company would succeed and I'm very willing to accommodate them, an inclusive government but not a coalition government.

I will not agree ever to have a coalition government with them. Pero marami na silang pumasok ngayon. Well, of course, the known Left is Bello, but he is not our enemy. He's been the Secretary of Justice.


E 'yung paningin lang niya sa buhay, pabor siya siguro sa—just like me and the others because anak lang kami ng mahirap. We could not be sympathizing with the capitalists, 'yung may-ari ng barko, eroplano.

Ang amin kasi dito ay we grow up in a—people lang kami, hanggang diyan lang 'yung, pati 'yung hanapbuhay ng mga magulang namin. But, kung maka-tsamba tayo dito, then we'll have a respite ofcommunism in this country.

But what I would like to say is this: Kausap ko si Murad, okay. Tapos sabi nila: "We'll talk." Nur Misuari, nag-uusap talaga kami up to the time sa release ng Norwegian. Pasalamat ako sa kanya. Okay siya.

The problem is this: Nung ikot ako nang ikot, there are some groups or sectors na ayaw talaga. And because ang anak kong babae, by the way ang lola ko Moro, lolo ko Chinese on the mother side.

'Yung anak ko si Lovely, Maranao-Tausug 'yan. So I sent her to Jolo tapos naka-usap ko pa si Tarhata, Tata. Sabi ko, "Ta, magpunta ako diyan, puwede ba tayong mag-usap?" Sabi niya, "Hindi, maghanap lang ako ng paraan na kung nandito ka o nandiyan kami, dalhin ko." "Sige, dalhin mo 'yung—bakit ayaw? 'Yung ayaw." 'Di nakausap ko 'yung ayaw talaga, ayaw makipag-usap at gusto, giyera.

Sabi ko, ano pa ba ang gusto ninyo, when do you want to stop? Ito ang ano, sabi nila, kasi 'yung ipinakita ko kay Obama, I was trying to explain to him bakit hindi mahinto-hinto ang Mindanao.

And also to impress upon him na kayo ang nagbigay ng rason, bakit ganito ngayon kami. Actually, resulta ito ng pag pang-agaw nila sa atin 'nung panahon 'nung mga lolo natin.

So sabi ko, bakit? Sabi nila, okay lang, Rod. Kung kayo magpunta dito, puwede kayong pumasok. Maybe 'yung ibang grupo i-hold ka nang sandali pero palalayasin ka. Pero 'yung iba, huwag. Kasi talagang galit kami.

Then he showed to me the pictures of the, 'yung—Bud Dajo something massacre. 'Yung katawan ng mga hinulog nila diyan sa isang—isang butas lang. And so many other pictures.

Sabi nila, kasi 'yung, you know, if you remember, if you are viewing ANC, sabi 'to ni Lozada, ni Tatad, 'yung—tumanda na sa trabaho na hindi naman talaga nagre-research, pretending to know all. Sabi nila, "Ayan oh, si Rody, bakit niya ipinakita one century ago 'yun? Tapos na 'yun."

Hindi nga nila alam, ipinakita nga ng mga—itong matitigas na mga bata, this wound would never heal, sabi niya. Hindi ito past. Present perfect ito palagi. And because of this, ayaw talaga namin 'yung Amerikano.

Sabi niya, "Mayor, kung nandiyan 'yung Amerikano, ang tingin namin, ang aming kalaban, Amerikano pa rin, ginagamit ang sundalong Pilipino."

That is why, in one of my statement, hindi ko sinabi kaagad na umalis. I said, there will be sometime in the future na paalisin ko ang mga special forces and there are about, 100, almost 117 of them. …Umalis muna kayo para kausapin ko, para ipakita ko na wala kayo at kung talagang magkasunduan, umalis kayo sa Mindanao.

I never said, get out of the Philippines. After all, kailangan natin 'yan sila diyan sa China Sea. Wala man tayong mga armaments. But we are not also ready to go to war with China. Ako, ayoko. Kasi it would just be a massacre. A raid against the two F-50s natin, if bigyan tayo, pabilhan tayo ng mga missile. But the problem is, ayaw nila tayong bigyan. Kinuha natin 'yan sa Korea. Correct, but that is American technology and you cannot but it without the consent of America.

Wala 'yung atin, for display. Wala namang missile 'yan eh. So we cannot use it. I really do not know what's wrong with this American, pagtingin nila sa atin.

Masyadong makababa then I embark on some—nagkandidato ako. I promised no corruption. I promised to stop the war and I would declare the war against drugs, then I promise to take care of criminality.

'Yung tatlo lang naman talaga ang humihila sa atin eh. 'Yung corruption number one 'yan. But I assure you and you can take your word for it, my word really rather: Hihinto 'yang corruption sa gobyerno. Hintuin ko talaga 'yan.

Itong sa drug war, I started to embark on it, oh kita mo ngayon, lumabas. After this, you listen to the continuing investigation.

'Di ba sinabi ko sa inyo, the drug was being operated inside the penitentiary. Sabi ko eleksyon, saan tayo makakita, a country allowing the drug syndicates to operate inside the Muntinlupa at directing the traffic.

The investigation is going right now. You look at ANC. Lumabas na ngayon, lahat sila, involved.

From the looks of it, tinitingnan ko kanina. It would be unfair to say that si De Lima was into drug trafficking but by implication, kasi she allowed them through her driver pati sila Baraan, I was correct all along because I was supplied with a matrix. Hindi ko na lang sabihin galing kanino.


Hindi galing sa atin. 'Di ba sinabi ko sa inyo, 'yan driver niya si Baraan. I was correct all along because I was supplied with the intercept and the matrix.

So ngayon, the drug problem really was the source, ang gobyerno. And it was ran by implied—they were allowed women and the last time na sentence ko, pag-alis ko, pasok 'yung mga babae, inuman. Anong klaseng gobyerno na 'to?

Ako sa totoo lang kung ganon, if I were the president that time, I would have declared Martial Law. Tutal, there is really a rebellion dito eh.

Nagpapatayan, we lose soldiers. Ako ngayon, I lose on the average two policemen a day, kasali ang military because I have ordered you guys to join because of the widespread use.

Noong mayor ako, istrikto ako dito. Sabi ko pinapatay, pinapatay ko talaga. The problem is, I did not know the whole dimension of the contamination. It was only when I became President at piniga ko na ang lahat, naglabasan, hundreds by the thousands, not let alone 'yung survey ni General Santiagosa PDEA noon, now he is still a General, si Sid Lapeña na there are about three million addicts in this country, may tama iyan.

Ngayon, plus the 700 idagdag mo na lang, tutal two or three years lang naman yung statement na yun, there has to be an increase in numbers.Kaya hindi ko ano alam kung gaano kahirap ang gawin natin. Four million, seven—ah!  3,700,000 Filipinos. It's not a joke.

Kaya nga noong natapos itong operate nang operate ang mga military pati pulis sa Maynila, there was a drastic drop in crime. Wala ng rape, meron pero seldom, iyong hold-up, iyong patay, iyong bata, na-rape maski anong whatever be the age.

You know, ayaw nilang maniwala, nagsabi na yung mga Amerikano na forensics that constant use of shabu three to six months everyday even for one state would shrink your brain. Kaya ito talaga lumalaban.

Ngayon alam ko na kung bakit malalakas ang loob nila. Binack-up sila mismo ng Department of Justice. Kaya early on, marami ang patay kaya lumaban talaga because they thought that they had this already license to do so.

Kasi ang mga backer nila, galing na doon sa Department of Justice. Some of them, fraternity brothers ko pa. Pati 'yan si Vit Aguirre is my brod also. Pero meron kami diyang mga brods sa San Beda, sa frat ko, kasi si De Lima galing San Beda. So this scandal is—the San Beda scandal. Tang-ina, susmaryosep.


Pero totoo iyan, si Aguirre is I think from La Union. Mahusay na abogado iyan. Ito yung nag-libre ni Web, dalawang witness ang nagsabi na puro dugo, dalawang witness niya. Napalabas ni Aguirre na parang sinungaling, acquitted ang buang.

So yung—marami tayong medyo tagilid na. Mabuti't na lang, we are freed of the war now against the—if we succeed, that wouldika nga, the last part of my talk with you.

I have told all your commanders, the Chief-of-Staff that you will get everything you need to fight the enemy of the states. For starters, sabi ko bilisan mo yung protection ano, dito sa katawan. You'll have it and I also told him to fast track the acquisition of Barrett, sabi ko. We're doing good.The Philippine military is doing good sa sniper-sniper. So you better train. But most of all, you have to train yourself, you have to reinvent yourself from all soldier nandyan sa—itong terrorism. It will come. Huwag ninyo akong tanungin at darating, it will come.

And you know, the fighting in Sulu, static yung enemy mo, puwede mong isa-isahin lang, itong NPA habulan palagi. So, but most of all, I think start to profile a bomber or a terrorist.

Usually yan nakaka-cap, naka-shades, ang buhok pag minsan makita mo peke, naka-toupee, that's the wig of the men, toupee. Pag-aralan mo yung—lalo na yung mata. Malikot ang mata ng terrorista. I have photo, 'yung close up ng ano nila. So iyan pag-aralan ninyo because terrorism is the next.

And maybe, hindi masyado kailangan ninyo 'yung long arms. You will have to study crime and detection, bomba tapos yung profiling. How to deal with them kasi ang kalaban natin diyan, hindi naman paramihan. One, two, three, four, five, so baka sibilyan na kayong lahat, but you have to—Kasi ang terorista naman, hindi naman puputok ng IED diyan sa bukid na yan, no purpose. If you want to make a political statement, you do it, mga siyudad na maraming—lalo  na yung mga progressive na—yan New York, meron sila the other day.

Tayo, ganun rin lalo na kung magkalabuan 'to. It's not so much about old men there, the old fogey. But 'yung mga bata na ayaw talagang makalimutan 'yung—so, that fight was not one century ago. That fight was started one century going on until now. From the—I said, sabi ko nga from the Spaniards, Americans, sa atin.

Eh ang buhay ganito lang eh. Where you find yourself in this universe, in this planet? Eh nagkita-kita tayo dito, we happen to be Filipinos in this land.

So we are here and we want peace that is why we have a government to run the country. We are mandated by law to preserve our territory and protect the citizens. That is a sworn duty and the people pay us. So we must be conscious of that. So kailangan talaga na, to the max ang efforts natin when the time comes.

Ngayon, lahat ng anti-terrorism equipments, marami ng nagpunta: China, India, Israel. Sabi ko, there will be only be at least one or two source sa ating intelligence equipment.

Hindi tayo pwedeng mag basta bili-bili na lang sa iba, kasi nakikinig yan sila sa atin. Para tayong buang, may satellite sa taas eh. But there are about two countries na where we are safe, mga kaalyado.

But all others, 'yung firepower, we can get the cheap ones pero basta ibigay ko sa inyo lahat ng ano, and I hope that as fast as they can produce it, I have decided to arm you all, all enlisted men and... Now, side arm, it's the Glock caliber 45, Glock 30.(applause)

Bantay kayo, lagay diyan, tapos punta kadoon sa Monkayo, inum-inom para pag wala ng mabaril, eh yung pulis na lang yung hinahamon. (laughter) Iyon naman ang nababasa ko. Nasa bar ang inuman nitong putang-inang pulis, tapos dumating itong Army, nag-agawan sa microphone sa "My Way,"ayun.(laughter)My way of dying. Okay yan, kung walang iba ng—but I—you should get it as fast as Israel can produce it. I am buying, so ilan kayo? Almost 130. 130,000 plus? So that's 130,000 bibilhin ko yan para sa inyo. Then the most important one is the—


But those doing covert, we can provide you with the thinner one, yung level three yata. Kapag tamaan ka nun at least maski armalite, ang impact diyan is greatly reduced. So iyan na ang ano ko, you will have the priority sa spending.Because you know sabi ko nga eh: I cannot run a country with a weak armed forces and  I cannot run a country with a corrupt police.

So inuna ko talaga yung mga generals. Wala na akong magawa eh. Lumabas talaga doon sa ano but little did I know that it was not really our handiwork. Came from somebody else's hand. Tinanggap na nung binasa natin.

So everytime I read it I am reminded by the guy who said it. You know those things there are all true. If you want to hear the conversation, no need because it was the unknown, always done.

So sana, can I have a stronger military, tutal wala man akong hingiin sa inyo, pareho lang tayo gobyerno. I am just a co-worker. Parang ako lang supervisor because in a democracy, the head of state is always elected by the people, of course. But aside from the title pareho lang tayo. So I am just as much interested as you.

Lahat ng ano, tapos by the end of the year, you should have felt the increase of salaries. Inuna ko talaga kayo doblado na kayo ng mga pulis.

So a few in the Army but plenty of the police. Ang pulis, pag inilibing mo,kung namatay, tag-dalawa ang pamilya. Pinaka-minimum, dalawa ang pamilyang umiiyak. Walang ginawa kasi itong mga gago na ito kundi mag-istambay diyan sa mga bar.

Kung sino yung maganda, usually may sugar daddy yan. Iyong matanda na lingaw-lingaw na lang gyud. Pero ang tsuktsak na genuine, itong mga pulis na batan-on. When they fell in love, so some of them bayaan ang pamilya. Kaya binubugbog ko talaga ang mga buang na iyan eh. Magsumbong yung asawa, "huhuhu, Mayor, suntok, sipa dito pa". Sabi ko, "Huwag na, huwag na, okay lang."

Kung minsan, itong pulis hindi muna—lalo na yung PNP na, aysusmaryosep. Gusto kong ibalik iyan sa ano, ibalik ko yang Philippine Constabulary. Yang pulis na yan, diyan na kayo kung saan kayo. But I will return the Philippine Constabulary under the—four commands: Army, tapos Philippine Constabulary. Kasi kailangan ko ng tao sa urban terrorism like the SAF, yung mga bata. Yung iba diyan, wala na. I forgot, is the lists with you? Itong aide ko taga-ano ito, she's shine, she's a Tausug. Na-ano ito, aide ko.

This will be the last and it is still being validated until now. Sa drugs, ang kalaban natin, ang gobyerno mismo, kasi dito, puro karamihan dito, halos kalahati, barangay captains. That's the reason why I joined the call for suspension of the barangay elections.

One is that it's expensive, but more than that, ito yung mga first and you will have the precursors of narco-politics. Nabasa na ninyo yan. Kayong mga opisyal, binigyan ko kayo ng libro. Because itong mga ito, they will use money again to be reelected. Kapag nandiyan yan sila, they hold power maski anong gawin mo because the law vests in them, power, talagang babalik iyan and it will be the beginning of a narco-politics in this country.

If I do not interdict, itong mga ito: mga governor, mayors, congressman, ito first pa lang: Region 1, elected official, Mayor Reynaldo Flores, Naguilian, La Union, validated three times.

Yun, kaya importante na marunong ako maggamit ng power ko, tanggalin ko yung—sabihin ko sa military pati pulis na naka-assign, "umalis kayo diyan, return to your mother unit immediately within 24 hours."

Oh kita mo, pag nawala 'yan, tapos sinabi ko sila, pumunta kayo sa Crame, you report. Oh, 'di takbo-takbo ang mga buang. Pero hindi mo 'yan mapatakbo, mayayabang 'yan eh. Oh nong sinabi ko, 24 hours patayin ko kayo. Kasi pag hindi, sabihin ko talaga sa kanya, gamitin mo 'yung wheelchair mo. Pasabugin mo 'yang—eh because that will mean the end of the Republic of the Philippines.

Then I said, you had the books, we will be like South America, failed states. Mayor doon, nag-take ng oath, babae—umaga, pagka hapon patay. Anak ng! You do not want that for your country.Lalo na kayo. You are here, your children, wala kayo. You are not the ordinary husband that would take care of the family with your presence there. Eh kung magkalat ito nang ganito, kagaya ng Maynila, magpulot ng bata, mawala, makita na lang doon sa ano, hubad, patay. 

Gaya diyan sa Mandug. May reunion sa December, ang bata niya na six months old, dinala ng nanay kasi reunion. Kinarga ng kapatid niya, 'oh, ito pala ang pamangkin ko.' Then suddenly nawala. Ito totoo 'to, check the records. May nakita na doon sa riverbank doon sa Mandug, bukas na ang tiyan nung bata. Tapos tanungin mo, "bakit mo man ginawa 'yan?" Sagutin ba naman ako, o di ikaw sagutin ka ng gano'n, "Eh gano'n talaga ako mayor, wala nga akong mahindot, pati yung mga kambing namin."

Ay sabi ko, tang-ina 'to, timing talaga siya. Eh yung Christmas na 'yun, may nagregalo sa akin na 357 Snubnose Ruger, eh di tamang-tama talaga. Putang-ina niya, diyan sa istasyon noon.

Sabi ko, balikan natin ang ano natin. Hindi ako natatakot, sabihin nilang martial law – martial law. Basta ang sinabi ko ganito and I am going: Stick to your mandate, do no wrong. Pag may order to go after these criminals, go after them. 'Yung—simply to say that, gobyerno ako, Army ako, sumurrender ka.

Pagka bumunot, patayin mo. Pag hindi bumunot, patayin mo rin. (laughter) Putang-ina, para matapos na. Eh kaysa mawala pa yung baril. Ako na ang bahala sa inyo. 

Itaga ninyo ito sa puso ninyo: For as long as I am the President, nobody but nobody, no military man or policeman will go to prison because they performed their duties well. Ako ang magpakulong, sir.

Sabihin mo lang, utos ni Mayor 'yun. Kasi sabi niya, pag hindi daw kami sumunod, kami daw ang patayin niya. Eh di patayin nalang namin itong ulol na 'to, kaysa kami ang mabaril. Sabi pa naman ni Mayor, sa bayag ko kayo barilin para mawala na. Trabaho lang kayo. Hindi ako mag-order ng illegal.Wag kayong maniwala diyan. I did not order you and the police to perform punitive police action. I have declared war against the drug syndicates in this country.

You know what is war. War is war. I'll explained to the another forum, tutal nagkaintindihan na tayo dito. Wag kayong matakot na ano—pwede niyo akong mukhain, puntahan ninyo ako sa bahay, tang-ina, akala ko ba, protektado kami?

For as long as there is the power to pardon sa Constitution, 'yan ang weapon ko against crime. Mag-massacre kayo ng isang daan, isang daan rin kayo, eh di pardon lahat eh. Restored to full political and civil rights plus a promotion to boot. Basta gano'n mga—lalo na, high profile.

We have to remove them from the syndicates or remove them from this planet. Para yung mga anak natin otherwise, kung ganito karami 'adre, hindi ko alam ganito pala ka—this is all over the country ha? Hindi lang ito isang region, lahat na 'to.

Kung hindi ko tapusin 'to, we could have compromised the country, this generation at 'yung mga apo ninyo. Kawawa 'yan mga anak natin. Dito na ngayon, dito na kayo sumunod sa akin kasi may garantiya ako at alam kong maglaro rin, the legal tools to protect us from harassment.

But remember, I will always protect you, trabaho lang kayo not only against drugs but against—yung mga human rights – human rights, hayaan mo yan, hindi ako papayag na—human rights, ….. (laughter) buwisit ka.

So with that, I have to talk to the mayors and governors ngayon. Ito, parang ayaw eh, parang takot. Sasabihin ko talaga, kailangan nandoon sila sa SMX na ano, magtrabaho kayo o hindi? Pag hindi, putang-ina, papalitan ko kayo.

Alam mo, sikreto diyan? Intelligence fund. Lahat ng opisyal, may intelligence fund. Ako lang ang sa buong Pilipinas na mayor na nagbibigay ng intelligence fund because the original chairman ganun. Yyung iba, diretso sa bulsa nila 'yan. Oh kayo, matagal man kayong nagserbisyo sa akin.

Lahat ng anoh nasa libro plano, ibinigay ko sa inyo at sa pulis and that is why, nung election, maski na aminin niyo o hindi, alam kong malakas ako sa Army pati pulis.

Hindi man kayo nagkamali sa akin. Hindi kayo nagkamali sa akin. Talagang ako, nung mayor ako, protektado ko yung mga tao sa gobyerno basta nagtratrabaho. At wala kayo—ang atin dito is para magtrabaho, hindi naman yan pupunta dito para mag— Anyway, madrama pa 'yan.

'Yung Trust Trade, binigyan niya ako ng mga ano—eh nagsabi ako mag-order ako para sa lahat. Sabi niya, matagalan 'yan. Hindi basta-basta magproduce ng almost 130,000 Glocks.

Ito ganito. Glock 30 kasi Du30. (laughter) Hindi, hindi. [applause] Hindi, ganun 'yan. Ang Glock 30 is a 45, parang commander size yan, colt commander or shorter. It's 7 ano rin, para nang regular 45 pero ito, tested ito maski madumi, maganda kasi ang pagkagawa. Magaganda ang mga tolerances din niyan.

So ito, yung—alam mo 'yung Glock, alam mo na, di ba i-cock mo, 'yun na 'yung lock, ang problema natin, 'yung sanay sa armas—kasi itong kamay natin malikot. Maghawak tayo ng baril, automatic ang kamay naka—Oh sa labas, lalo na kung may media, ilabas kaagad para ganun talaga. Pero di tayo maghawak maski na yan sa kwarto, pag ano automatic, 'yung muscle memory, nakaganun kaagad. Kung minsan naka-inom, ilagay diyan ang—uhmm, Boom!!

"Sir, si major." "O bakit?" "Nawala na 'yung utin niya kasi pumutok."(laughter)Para fair, para fair 'yung sa mga opisyal, i-raffle ninyo dalawa. Kayo namang nandyan sa likod, maghintay kayo ng promotion ninyo.

Pero bigyan mo ako ng Valor, ng medalya, tingnan mo kung anong ibigay ko sa 'yo. Totoo. Wala akong pera pero magaling ako. Marami man akong kaibigan na milyonaryo, house and lot ka dito sa Davao.

Valor, bigyan mo ako ng Valor dito. May Valor dito? Kasi kung—maghanap kayo ng away dun. Sa mga opisyal, ano ito, inyo na 'to ha? Nandito sa gobyerno, kaibigan 'to:

"Congratulations! You have just been awarded with one unit Glock 30 caliber ACP Automatic—Safe action." Safe action kaya pumuputok diyan sa –"Blue finish", anak ng jueteng, "10+1 shot cock?" Ang galing nito. 

This is to certify that this is yours for free on the occasion of Mayor—President pala—Rodrigo Roa Duterte's grateful recognition for your invaluable contribution to the fight against illegal drugs and criminality. Courtesy of Trust Trade. Signed at Malacanan Palace, Manila blah, blah, blah. Si Germie yan ng Trust Trade.

O ang mga opisyal, kasi baka magalit sa akin magputok yung Glock ninyo diyan. 'Yung isa, sa tropa. So yun lang ang ma—pero kung may Valor, ah house and lot dito, may babae na. (laughter) Tsaka may mga anak na, yung may dati nang may ano, hiniwalayan. May pamilya ka na agad tapos may pamilya rin, doon kayo sa inyo. (laughter) Hindi, totoo. Give me a Valor and I will give you something very, very good.

So I have to fly back, it's getting dark. I still have to comply with another obligation.

Maraming salamat po.
