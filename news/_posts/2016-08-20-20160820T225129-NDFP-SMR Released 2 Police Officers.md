The National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP)-Southern Mindanao Region (SMR) ordered the release of two "prisoners of war" on 20 August 2016, who were held captive in Davao Oriental.

In a statement, NDFP-SRM Spokesperson Rubi del Mundo said Chief Inspector Arnold S. Ongachen and Police Officer 1 Michael B. Grande have been ordered release from separate custody by units under the New People's Army (NPA)-Compostela Valley Davao Gulf Sub-Regional Command.
They were released as "goodwill measure" for the formal resumption of the peace negotiations, del Mundo said.
Judicial proceedings and investigations into "possible war crimes and violation of people's rights" committed by Ongachen and Grande "have been effectively suspended in deference to appeals of their families and peace advocates."
