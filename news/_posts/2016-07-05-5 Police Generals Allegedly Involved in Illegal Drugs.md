President Rodrigo Duterte named five Philippine National Police (PNP) Generals allegedly involved in illegal drugs during his speech on the 69th Anniversary of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) celebration held in Clark, Pampanga on 5 July 2016.
The President said that they are protectors of the drug syndicate in the country.

Those named are Director General Marcelo Garbo, Jr.; Police Director Bernardo Diaz; Quezon City Police Director Edgardo Tinio; former National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Chief Joel Pagdilao; and retired General Vicente Loot, who is now mayor of Daanbantayan town in Cebu.

The two retired Police Generals are Director General Marcelo Garbo, Jr. who was deputy chief for administration prior to his retirement in March 2016 and General Vicente Loot who retired on 12 July 2015 and ran for mayor of Daanbantayan, Cebu, where he won and was inaugurated in office.

To the three Police Generals who are still in active duty, the President said, "At this time, I ordered them relieved from their assignments and report to the Director General. I would like to talk to them but certainly I would expect the Police Commission to do their thing. Imbestihagan ninyo ito at huwag ninyo akong bigyan ng zarzuela na ano. Hanapin ninyo ang totoo (Investigate on this and I do not want you giving me a farce report. Find the truth)."

All the named five PNP Generals denied the allegation made by President Duterte and the three active officers had reported to PNP Chief Ronal Dela Rosa within less than 24 hours after hearing the revelation of the President.

The National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) had formed a committee that will oversee the investigation regarding the five police officers.
The group is composed of lawyers who will be involved in evidence gathering, evaluation and validation of facts.
The committee is tasked to gather and confirm evidence in seven days and will be submitted to an adhoc committee for recommendation.
Among the evidence seen by NAPOLCOM commissioners were in the form of intelligence reports.
