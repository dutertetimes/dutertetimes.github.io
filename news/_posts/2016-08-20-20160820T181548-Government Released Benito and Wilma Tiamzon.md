The government released the two highest ranking rebels in its custody on 20 August 2016 for their participation in the formal peace negotiations to be held in Oslo, Norway.
Benito and Wilma Tiamzon was granted temporary passes for the duration of the peace talks beginning 22 August 2016.

"Nagpapasalamat kami kay Presidente Duterte na maibabalik sa tamang landas ang usapang pangkapayapaan. Kailangan mapaksa ang makabuluhang usapin sa ating lipunan at mga batayan kung bakit mayroong digmaan na nangyayari (We thank President Duterte for helping the peace process get back on track. There is a need for people to know what’s going on and the reasons why there is war)," Wilma said after their release.

Benito Tiamzon was the chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines while his wife Wilma was the secretary general.
The Tiamzons, who were captured in Cebu City in March 2015, were the highest-ranking rebel leaders arrested by the government.

"There should no longer be any doubt that President Rodrigo Duterte is serious and determined to find a peaceful solution to the decades old communist insurgency in the country following the release of Benito and Wilma Tiamzon this morning," said Dureza.

The releases had to however undergo the normal judicial procedures required by law and regulations.
The President on 15 August ordered the Bureau of Immigration and the Department of Foreign Affairs to assist in providing the necessary travel documents and orderly departure of the National Democratic Front (NDF) consultants who will be participating in the peace negotiations in Oslo, Norway.
The 22 NDF consultants were issued Philippine passports and the Philippine embassy of the Royal Norwegian Government (RNG) also issued visas to all delegates from both panels who will travel to Norway for the historic reopening of the GRP-NDF peace negotiations.
