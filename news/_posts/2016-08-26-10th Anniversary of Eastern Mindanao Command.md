President Rodrigo Duterte attended the 10th Anniversary of the Eastern Mindanao Command (EASTMINCOM) in Naval Station Felix Apolinario, Panacan, Davao City on 26 August 2016 where he said, "To defend this republic, sabay-sabay tayong lahat." The President also articulated the country's need for a powerful standing army and expressed his trust to the Philippine military. "I can always rely on the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to keep the integrity of the Republic," said the Commander-in-Chief.

The President was welcomed to the event by National Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Ricardo Visaya and EASTMINCOM Commander Lt. Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero before he was accorded with full military honors.
President Duterte also led the awarding of 17 Philippine military personnel and civilians to honor their contributions for the welfare of the Filipino people.
