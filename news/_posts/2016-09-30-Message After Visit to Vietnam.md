But you know, somebody, he's a billionaire and computed...mental computation when we were chatting, we were drinking, hindi man ako makainom... So during this...we were about to yung bago ka matulog, we were in the... I was given the Presidential suite, so maraming upuan.
 
The billionaire made a computation. He said: You know mayor, I'll give you the economic impact of drugs in the country - your country.  And said, this is the way how it goes - There are at least, he said, you claim to be three million drug users and addicts; one hit daily costs around 200 or about 6,000 a month. If these users and addicts use drugs on a daily basis, that's about 18 billion a month or around 216 billion a year. Otherwise, his money would go to food, education therein.
 
And that was the cold reality and I was not able to sleep soundly that night and even... I was so stressed. Why, the figures? Because the mining industry gives us about 70 billion only and here is a cost of 16 billion, destroying lives—it's  an investment to destroy lives; it's an investment by the drug lords that will break the social fabric of our society.
 
Alam mo pag may adik sa pamilya - pag meron na magnakaw ng mga bagay-bagay na mga... ipagbili na yung mga kotse kung saan-saan. And, pag wala na, they go into crime and that is why nationwide, ang crime, went on a spindown.
 
We are going dun, mga almost 50 percent. In the entire country, wala na masyadong patayan. And here is a nation, which its ordinary government employees, are talking as if they are Gods. And to later on to be orchestrated or followed by their head.
 
Instead of coming over, knowing fully well, it could not escape their attention that I entered into the presidency of a budget that was prepared by my predecessor and that budget is in operation now. No other source. The budget for next year is being prepared. And now we have placed funds for building rehabilitations in the military camps, as I have requested the Armed Forces of the Philippines to weigh in, into the problem.

It's so exasperating bitaw. Knowing that I said it could not have escaped their attention. They are running a government also. Instead of saying: You know, Mr. Duterte instead of killing them, why don't you build several where?

Well, I get funds from the Office of the Foreign Affairs. Get it from Evasco, the Secretary of the government. Get it from the funds, the intelligence fund of the Armed Forces of the Philippines? Or Secretary Aguirre? - the newest enemy of my friend.

So, it's not allowed. That would be like robbing Peter to pay Paul. And this is the tragic thing about miscalculation, whether it is in business, whether at computing household. You have always to calculate correctly. That is why we have this Calculus and it's the greatest need for a Calculus, even in the military.

The danger is always miscalculation. I don't know if those guys there have the... pea-brained to think about calculations. It's only good, criticize that's it..in public.

There is the United Nations. You can always deliver your speech there. Pass the Commission on Human Rights or of voting, then go send some rapporteur.

And I was investigated during my mayorship days already. And there is the result. Ano gusto... my lady? And all these years, not a single case was filed against me. It's all talk until now.

Now, question is... quoted by the EU, by this, I said the pea-brained lawyers there. "That this official, this, even when he was mayor, he was threatening to  kill the criminals". What an idiot - group of idiots in the purest form.

You know, when you want to charge me. You have to find out if the penal laws of this land would make a mayor liable if he threatens the criminals or intimidate the wrongdoers.

You can read the penal codes, criminal laws of this land, you'll find nothing. And to say that this mayor has been threatening to kill criminal. Anong—kaya kung ikaw nandito bakit hindi ka magmumura?

You're portrayed or pictured to be some... a cousin of Hitler. And you do not even bother to find out, to investigate this? Imagine that, I will be facing and even the international court for genocide. Hindi ba naman kabalbagan ang mga — ...

Ikaw... presidente ka tapos ganunin ka. It was of course all right when I was mayor. Because then, that would be about just a miniscule of the affairs of the humanity in this planet. But when I am the president and the ...is get, you know bitter and stupid. You put all the Filipinos, especially outside, you put them to shame.

Okay lang sa akin. Sanay ako sa politika eh. Eh lahat ng kababuyan, dumating na sa aking buhay. Pero itong mga ganito, my Lord,  ako, look - kayong US, EU - You can call me anything. But I was never into or I am never into hypocrisy like you.

Close your doors, it's wintertime. There are migrants escaping from the Middle East. You allow them to rot and then you're worried about the death of about 1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

Hitler massacred three million Jews. 

Now there is three million, there's a three million drug addict. There are. 

I'd be happy to slaughter them. 

At least if Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have you know, my victims - I would like to be, all criminals to finish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition.

Salamat po.
