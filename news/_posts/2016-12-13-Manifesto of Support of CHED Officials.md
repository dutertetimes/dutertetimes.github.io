RE: MANIFESTO OF SUPPORT TO HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE (PRRD) FOR HIS ACTION AND VISION IN USHERING GENUINE CHANGE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMISSION ON HIGHER EDUCATION (CHED)

__WE__, the undersigned officials and employees of the Commission on Higher Education, in the light of recent events and declarations of The Chief Executive—HIS __EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT DUTERTE__, in relation to the Commission on Higher Education, hereby fully manifest and pledge our wholehearted support for his desire and efforts to usher in GENUINE AND MEANINGFUL change in the Commission by instituting his brand of leadership and action-oriented, pro-people and pro-development perspectives;

__WE__, __AFFIRM__ that as the duly elected President of the Republic with an overwhelming majority, President Duterte carries the strong mandate to bring meaningful change in the country in general, as well as in CHED in particular;

__WE__, __RECOGNIZE__ that with this great mandate and yet challenging job of the Presidency, the President deserves the support and cooperation of all sectors of society to __REFORM__, __CHANGE__ and bring in the fruits of development to the people, the CHED included;

__WE__, __BELIEVE__ that __PRESIDENT DUTERTE'S__ actions leading to a change in the leadership of the Commission on Higher Education is well within his prerogative as the Chief Executive of all Executive Departments in the government of the Republic of the Philippines, pursuant to His constitutional power of control, appointment and removal. And that as part of this power, the President has the prerogative to choose freely the members of His official family—the CABINET.

__WE__, __SUBMIT__ that Cabinet members are his __ALTER EGOs__, chosen on the basis of __trust and confidence__, and clearly they serve at HIS pleasure, and thus, maybe replaced anytime with or without cause;

__WE__, __AFFIRM__ further that the CHED, is an important agency of the government in charge of the higher education sector and crucial in the development of human resource needed by the country for greater development, and thus, should be continuously represented in the __CABINET__ by a head who __enjoys the trust and confidence__ of the President, and who shares His principles, values, style of leadership, and perspective;

__WHEREFORE__, in order for the Commission on Higher Education to continue functioning properly in support of the thrusts, programs, principles, and values of the President of the Republic, __WE__, __HUMBLY PRAY AND REQUEST__ You, __Mr. President__, to now designate or appoint a Chairperson of the Commission of your own choice as your __ALTER EGO__ to represent the CHED in the Cabinet so that CHED will again be in the mainstream as are the other education agencies; and to appoint the other three (3) Commissioners who will now join and support your designated OIC or appointed Chairperson in the formulation and implementation of your programs of development for the higher education sector and for the greater benefit of the Filipino youth pursuant to the overall __VISION OF CHANGE__ and the __10-POINT AGENDA__ of the __DUTERTE ADMINISTRATION__.

__WE SEEK__ your urgent intercession, __MR. PRESIDENT__, in order to prevent the DEMORALIZATION among the ranks of the men and women of the Commission; arrest the further erosion and denigration of the reputation of the office; preserve the dignity of its officials and staff; and protect its operations to effectively serve its stakeholders.

__CHANGE IS COMING... CHANGE IS NOW!__

Thank you very much, Mr President.
