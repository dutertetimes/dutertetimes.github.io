On 23 December 2016, Vice President Leni Robredo released a statement on the "Threat of a Return to Martial Law".
The following is her full statement.

The threat of a return to Martial Law and one-man-rule is the worst Christmas gift to the Filipino people.

To refer to specific provisions in the 1987 Constitution prohibiting such as a "reckless reaction" to the Marcos regime is an insult to the experience of the Filipino nation that endured great suffering and hardship under the Martial Law regime.

Moreover, for President Duterte to challenge the democratic safeguards of the very constitution he swore to uphold on June 30, 2016 is appalling.

Let us remain vigilant against the threat of Martial Law, and fight against any move that will curtail our freedoms.

This is not a battle we will take sitting down. As Filipinos, we have demonstrated our courage to stand up and make our voices heard for the sake of protecting our freedom and fighting for the truth.
