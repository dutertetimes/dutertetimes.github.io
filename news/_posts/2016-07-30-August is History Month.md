August is now the Philippine History Month as declared in Proclamation No. 339 of 2012 which was signed by former President Benigno S. Aquino III.
It repealed Proclamation No. 1304 signed by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1974 which made September 15-21 as the Philippine History Week.

The 2016 History Month theme is "Kasaysayan, Saligan ng Diwang Makabayan" which is aimed to promote nationalism.
The celebration of History Month will kick off on August 1 with the commemoration of the 72nd Death Anniversary of former President Manuel L. Quezon at the Manuel Quezon Museum in Quezon City; commemoration of the 7th Death Anniversary of former President Corazon C. Aquino at Roxas Boulevard in Manila; Project Saysay Posters Turn Over Program at Culaba, Biliran; and a documentary film showing at the University of Makati.
