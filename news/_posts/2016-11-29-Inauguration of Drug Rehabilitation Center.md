President Rodrigo Roa Duterte led the unveiling of Phase 1 of the Mega Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (DATRC) inside the largest military reservation in the country, Fort Ramon Magsaysay in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija.

The 10-hectare rehabilitation center planned in four phases started construction in July.
It has a construction area total of 60,000 square meters with 172 building units.
It is expected to accommodate around 10,000 patients which is the largest drug rehabilitation center in the country to date.

Huang Rulun is a 65-year-old honorary chairman of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Association of the Philippines Foundation, Inc. (FFCAP) and chairman of the board of directors of Century Golden Resources Group.
He met the President in Davao on June 28 before he donated P1.4 billion for the construction of two drug rehabilitation centers inside Fort Magsaysay.

He expressed gratitude towards Rulun during the inauguration saying, "Please accept my gratitude and that of the Filipino people."
He called Rulun a "good Samaritan" and said, "He just came out of nowhere and went to my office and said that he would help me solve the drug problem."

Huang stated that the donation was his way of showing support to the administration’s war against drugs and as a sign of goodwill for the President’s efforts to strengthen the country's ties and friendly relations with China.

The President, during his speech, iterated his conviction against illegal drugs, "Let me warn you, drugs is a very virulent agent in any society. The campaign against drugs will continue till the last day of my term. I will not stop until the last drug pusher is out of the street and the last drug lord or king killed. Yan ang pangako ko sa inyo."
