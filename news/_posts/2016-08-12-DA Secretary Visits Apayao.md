Speaking in front of local executives, municipal agriculturists, farmers and fisherfolk association leaders, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel F. Piñol presented the Special Area for Agricultural Development (SAAD) program, which aims to develop the food production potential of an area.

SAAD will only focus on the provision of livelihood programs which was proven to be a sure-fire formula in addressing poverty.
Among the livelihood options identified for implementation are:

1. Family-based Food Production Program (FFPP) wherein the 4Ps beneficiaries under the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) will be tapped as participants and will expand into food production projects.

2. Family-based Agro-forestry wherein an identified upland family is designated caretaker of an area with harvestable tree species.

3. Vegetable production using the Israel Green House Technology and backyard gardening as well.

Other livelihood activities include contract farming, establishment of hogstel, and dairy farming.

"Our new paradigm in DA is to provide you options and leave the planning to you," Secretary Piñol said.
Assistant Secretary for policy planning and special projects Lerey Panes emphasized in SAAD, all aspects of agriculture in the priority provinces will be focused on.
The planning will be done by the province and not the department, thus, the creation of a Provincial Management Group and one SAAD officer based in the province will be conducted to ensure smooth implementation of the program.

Piñol encouraged the local officials to come up with provincial ordinances to transform Apayao into an agro-tourism site.
"I believe we can open up the opportunities of the provinces, if we open the transportation and tourism sectors," Piñol stressed.
Apayao has more 35,000 hectares of agricultural land devoted to rice, corn, cassava, banana and coffee production.
Lansones, rambutan, lychee, durian and mangosteen also grow on its vast production areas.

During the visit, Piñol approved the allotment of P100-million budget for various livelihood programs of the province.
According to the secretary the P50 million can be used now and the remaining P50 million can be used in the first semester of 2017.
The province of Apayao also received P42.6 million worth of agricultural assistance which include a four-wheel drive tractor, rice combine harvester, corn combine harvester, cassava digger/uprooter, open source pump, corn planter, mechanical corn dehusker/sheller, cassava pulverizer, and cassava chipper.
The Secretary also distributed certificates of turn-over for the rehabilitation of three farm-to-market roads: Anganopan to Paco Valley, Badduat to Culilimtaw, and Kariktan to Dinakpan.

In his message, Piñol announced that President Duterte has verbally approved his proposal to take over a corn processing facilities owned by NABCOR across the country, following a report from Apayao Governor Elias C. Bulut of the non-operation of the facility in the province. He appointed CAR Regional Executive Director Lorenzo Caranguian to take over the management of the said facility.

"We will look at it as a benchmark engaging the success of the program. After three years, we will come back to the province and assess the poverty incidence of Apayao. We will not stop or end our commitments until we are able to address poverty in your province," committed Agriculture Secretary Manny Piñol.
