Vice President Leni Robredo was disinvited to the President's first Vin d'Honneur on 11 January 2017 according to her spokesperson Georgina Hernandez.

The Inquirer reported that they previously asked a source whether the Vice President was invited to the event and the source replied, "Isn't the Vice President traditionally invited [to the event]?"

According to GMA News Online, Vice President spokesperson Georgina Hernandez, in a statement, said that an invitation was e-mailed to their office 28th of December and "on January 4, Malacañang called the Office to retract the invitation, stating that the guest list was limited."

Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella told reporters in an ambush interview on the day of the event that "it is the prerogative of the Palace to invite those who they feel is needed to be there."
