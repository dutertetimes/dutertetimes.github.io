The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed several [criminal complaints against Senator Leila De Lima and 17 others] with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on 10 November 2016 in connection with their alleged involvement in the proliferation of illegal drugs inside the New Bilibid Prison (NBP).

Senator Leila De Lima said she is no longer surprised by the filing of criminal complaints against her by the NBI.
"I'm no longer surprised when this administration files trumped-up charges against me," she said in a statement.

"Like their propensity for manufacturing lies, the filing of charges is fast becoming a bad habit for them. They just wont quit until they destroy me," she added.

De Lima maintained that the evidence against her "has always been manufactured, fabricated, and the product of fantasists".

"Even the testimonial and documentary evidence presented during the House hearing on which the NBI has based its charges has shown nothing but fantastic lies and fairy tales linking me to the drug trade," the senator said.

Maintaining her innocence, De Lima promised to face her accusers before the proper forum.

"At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I repeat that I stand by my innocence because I only speak the truth. I shall in the proper time confront my accusers before the proper venue," the senator said.
