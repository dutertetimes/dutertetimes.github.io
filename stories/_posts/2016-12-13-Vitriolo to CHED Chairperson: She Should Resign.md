The Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) executive director Julito Vitriolo, the highest-ranking career executive in the commission, has called for the resignation of CHEd Chairperson Dr. [Patricia Licuanan] after she was told not to attend Cabinet meetings starting 5 December 2016.

"I think she should resign, step down and respect the authority of the President," Vitriolo said in a phone interview as reported by The Philippine Star on 12 December 2016.

"She should wake up and realize that this is a new political ballgame. Members of the Cabinet are occupying political positions, which are based on trust and confidence of the Chief Executive," he added.

Vitriolo claimed most of the career officials at the agency share the same sentiment.

According the The Philippine Star report, a few days after the "desist" instruction from the President on 4 December, Vitriolo wrote to the President asking to appoint an officer-in-charge who can serve as the President's alter ego at the agency.

Vitriolo said in the letter that Licuanan's refusal to file a courtesy resignation demanded by the President in Memorandum Circular 4 in August is "tantamount to gross insubordination" and that she is "usurping the authority and power of the CHED chairmanship".
CHEd Commissioners Alex Brillantes and Minella Alarcon filed their courtesy resignations in August and has remained in their posts until Malacañang acts on their resignation. Commissioner Ruperto Sangalang did not submit his resignation knowing his term already expired in July. He remains in holdover capacity until the President appoints his replacement.

Licuanan responded to Vitriolo's letter and accused the executive director of undermining the chairperson's authority.
"(His) action is not surprising, as he has a long track record of undermining CHED and its chair. He is simply up to his old tricks," Licuanan's camp said in a statement according to The Philippine STAR.

The CHED chair is set to convene a national directorate meeting this morning with other officials of the commission that includes Vitriolo.
It is the first time Licuanan and Vitriolo will meet since the surprise press briefing of the CHEd executive director in Malacañang on 8 December, which reportedly caught Licuanan off guard.
