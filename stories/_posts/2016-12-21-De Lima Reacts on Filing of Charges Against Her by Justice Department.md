Senator Leila De Lima reacts on the filing of charges against her by the Department of Justice at the Metropolitan Trial Court in Quezion City on 21 December 2016.
The following is her reaction on the matter.

I can confirm that, today, my office received a copy of a Resolution of the National Prosecution Service (NPS) finding probable cause to charge me with violation of Article 150 of the Revised Penal Code (Disobedience to Summons issued by the National Assembly, its committees or subcommittees, etc.), in connection with the summons issued to Ronnie Dayan by the House Committee on Justice, particularly my act of advising him not to attend the House inquiry. Contrary to news reports, it is not for Obstruction of Justice under Presidential Decree No. 1829. I am not aware if there is such a separate charge, but, in any case, there would be no basis for it because the House inquiry is not a criminal proceeding that would bring the case within the ambit of PD 1829.

Unfortunately, since the NPS did not notify or serve me a copy of the complaint, I am in the difficult and lamentable position of standing publicly accused without even knowing what the allegations against me are. This rush to crucify me publicly through inaccurate press releases and statements, even before allowing me the chance to learn about the charges against me and to prepare my defense, speaks loudly and clearly of the real motivation behind the filing of this case.

Therefore, pending our receipt of the formal notice by the proper court, my legal team is currently reviewing all options available to us -- but with the disadvantage of not really knowing what the allegations and evidence against me are.  

Nevertheless, we will act with dispatch to answer the charge that this Administration has desperately hurled against me in order to save the House leadership from embarrassment for failing to link me to the drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison, and for shaming itself by engaging in rumor-mongering, slut-shaming and voyeurism.

In any case, I am putting my faith in our courts and in our judicial system to serve as our independent and fearless protectors against tyranny.
