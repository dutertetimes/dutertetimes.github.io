Vice President Leni Robredo released a statement on 30 December 2016 regarding "Oust Duterte".

> 30 December 2016
> 
> I am not aware of, much less am I involved in, any effort to “oust” the President.
> 
> Furthermore, I categorically deny joining rallies that called for the President’s ouster.
> 
> Criticism is not conspiracy, and the administration is well advised to stop seeing "plots" behind every unflattering news report, irate citizens' assembly, or angry Facebook post.
> 
> The President and I both took an oath to uphold the Constitution and I take this very seriously.
> 
> It is the right of every citizen in our democracy to express her opinion, and this includes those critical of or in opposition to an incumbent government. This principle is a cornerstone of our free Republic.
> 
> To my understanding, many criticisms of the President have come about as a reaction to his own actions and statements – the Marcos burial at Libingan ng mga Bayani, the ongoing extrajudicial killings, the proposed restoration of the death penalty, and the retreat from our West Philippine Sea claims, among others.
